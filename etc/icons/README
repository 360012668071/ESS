Creating pixmaps:

* spluslogo.xpm was dontated by David Smith at Insightful.

* Other icons were created by SJE, using mostly `kiconedit' and
  hand-editing.

* Transparency
Need to add backgrounToolBarColor for XEmacs to show okay.
e.g. /usr/share/xemacs-21.4.12/etc/toolbar/folder-cap-up.xpm
has header:
"X	c Gray75 s backgroundToolBarColor",
whereas I have set "c None" to indicate the background pixel; this line 
seems to work for both toolbars:
". c None s backgroundToolBarColor",

* splus_letters_small.xpm

2010-05-18: SJE made this new Splus icon from the
splus_letters_large.xpm file that Rich provided.  I had to move the
cross over to the left by one pixel, to then allow the image to be
cropped to 48x48 (cropping performed in gimp).  kiconedit was then
used to rescale the icon to 24x24.  Finally, background transparency
added manually to the file, as noted above.
