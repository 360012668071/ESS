A version of the gnuemacs tags program which has been modified to find
S function definitions.  You can use this to find a function
defintions or arbitrary strings in multiple related files.

If you are not familiar with the gnuemacs tags facility, read the Info
node on
 tags.

The etags program will now look for S function defintions in files
with suffix
 '.s'.

It only handles functions of the form:

 name <- function(

That is, where the name and 'function' keyword are on the same line
also, it will be fooled by things such as

  apply(x,1,function(x) median(x-median(x)))

However this only adds an uneccesary tag and does not prevent correct tags
from being found.

To compile, for emacs style tags:
cc -o etags -DETAGS etags.c

To compile for ctags style tags:
cc -o ctags -DCTAGS etags.c

If you have any problems, let me know.
