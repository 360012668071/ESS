	If you give etags the following option
	--regex="/[ \t]*(defmeth[ \t]+\([^-]+\)-proto[ \t]+\(:[^ (]+\)/\1\2/"
	it will create tags for methods.
	I assume that the object is always named xxx-proto
	and the name for the tag will be simply
	xxx:methodname

	I've tried it only in MS-DOS right nomw, but it should work
	also in unix.
