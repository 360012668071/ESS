* GENERAL
** TODO [#A] populate ess-autoload.el and call it from ess-site.el    :13_09:
   This will ensure that very quick start both for (require "ess-start") and
   MELPA users.
** TODO [#B] build ert based test suit                                :13_09:
** TODO split ess-mode into specialized derived modes
** TODO remote M-x ess-sas-interactive via shell with ssh  
   sets ess-process-name-list to (("shell"))
   This prevents iESS[SAS] evaluation since a value of (("SAS")) would be
   necessary for that.

** TODO make eldoc (ess--fun.start actually) work from withing strings
