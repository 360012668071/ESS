Variables for starting ESS
--------------------------

 - User Option: ess-ask-for-ess-directory
     Default: `t'
     If this variable has a non-`nil' value, then every time ESS is run
     with `M-x S' you will be prompted for a directory to use as the
     working directory for your S session; this directory should have a
     `.Data' subdirectory.  If the value of `ess-ask-for-ess-directory'
     is `nil', the value of `S-directory' is used as the working
     directory.

 - User Option: S-directory
     Default: Your home directory
     The working directory for your S session if
     `ess-ask-for-ess-directory' is `nil', and the default when
     prompting for a directory if it is not.  For example, you may wish
     to set this to the value of the current buffer's working directory
     before starting S by adding the following line to your `.emacs'
     file (*note Hooks::)
          (setq ess-pre-run-hook
             '((lambda () (setq S-directory default-directory))))

 - User Option: ess-ask-about-display
     Default: `nil'
     If this variable has a non-`nil' value, then every time ESS is run
     with `M-x S' you will be asked for a value for the `DISPLAY'
     environment variable to be used in the current S session.  If this
     variable is not set correctly, S will not be able to create any
     windows under the X windowing environment.  Completion is provided
     over the `X-displays-list' variable; the default is the current
     value of `DISPLAY'.  This feature is useful is you often run S on
     a different display than that of the machine you are running S
     from.  If `ess-ask-about-display' is `nil', the current value of
     `DISPLAY' is used.

 - User Option: X-displays-list
     Default: `'(":0.0")'
     List of possible values for the `DISPLAY' environment variable,
     provided for completion when prompting for such a value.

Variables for dump files
------------------------

 - User Option: ess-insert-function-templates
     Default: `t'
     If this variable has a non-`nil' value, then dumping a
     non-existent object will result in the edit buffer containing a
     skeleton function definition, ready for editing.

 - User Option: ess-source-directory
     Default: `"/tmp/"'
     Directory name (ending in `/') in which dump files are placed.
     This should always be a writable directory.

 - User Option: ess-source-directory-generator
     Default: `nil'
     Alternative, dynamic method of specifying the directory for dump
     files.

 - User Option: ess-dump-filename-template
     Default: USER_NAME`.'OBJECT_NAME`.S'
     Naming system to use for dumped object files.  *Note Source
     Directories::, for details of this and the previous two variables.

 - User Option: ess-keep-dump-files
     Default: `nil'
     Boolean flag signifying whether to keep dump files or to delete
     them after each use.  *Note Source Files::, for more details.


File: ess.info,  Node: Indentation variables,  Next: Variables controlling interaction,  Prev: Dump file variables,  Up: Variables

Variables controlling indentation
---------------------------------

 - User Option: ess-tab-always-indent
     Default: `t'
     If non-`nil', then `TAB' in the edit buffer always indents the
     current line, regardless of the position of point in the line.
     Otherwise, indentation is only performed if point is in the lines
     indentation, and a tab character is inserted is point is after the
     first nonblank character.

 - User Option: ess-auto-newline
     Default: `nil'
     Non-`nil' means automatically newline before and after braces
     inserted in S code.

   The following variables control amounts of indentation.  These
variables automatically become buffer-local in any ESS buffer, and so
setting any of these variables has effect in the current buffer only.

 - User Option: ess-indent-level
     Default: 2
     Extra indentation of S statement sub-block with respect to
     enclosing braces.

 - User Option: ess-brace-imaginary-offset
     Default: 0
     Extra indentation (over sub-block indentation) for block following
     an open brace which follows on the same line as a statement.

 - User Option: ess-brace-offset
     Default: 0
     Extra indentation for braces, compared with other text in same
     context.

 - User Option: ess-continued-statement-offset
     Default: 0
     Extra indent for lines not starting new statements.

 - User Option: ess-continued-brace-offset
     Default: 0
     Extra indent for substatements that start with open-braces.  This
     is in addition to `ess-continued-statement-offset'.

 - User Option: ess-arg-function-offset
     Default: 2
     Extra indent for arguments of function `foo' when it is called as
     the value of an argument to another function in `arg=foo(...)'
     form.  If not number, the statements are indented at
     open-parenthesis following `foo'.

 - User Option: ess-expression-offset
     Default: 4
     Extra indent for internal substatements of the call to
     `expression()' specified in
          `obj <- expression(...)'

     form.  If not a number, the statements are indented at
     open-parenthesis following `expression'.

 - User Option: ess-else-offset
     Default: 2
     Extra indentation of the `else' clause with respect to the
     corresponding `if'.

In addition, a number of default styles are defined for you (in
`ess-style-alist'):

 - User Option: ess-default-style
     Default: `DEFAULT'
     The default formatting style to use in edit buffers.  The DEFAULT
     style uses the values of the above indentation variables at
     load-time, so that changing these variables in your `.emacs' file
     will affect your buffer defaults.  Other styles are: `GNU', `BSD',
     `K&R', `CLB', and `C++'.  See `ess-cust.el' for the complete
     definitions of the styles.  *Note Edit buffer::, for more details.


File: ess.info,  Node: Variables controlling interaction,  Prev: Indentation variables,  Up: Variables

Variables controlling interaction with the ESS process
------------------------------------------------------

 - User Option: comint-input-ring-size
     Default: 50
     Number of commands to store in the command history.

 - User Option: ess-execute-in-process-buffer
     Default: `nil'
     If this is `nil', then the `ess-execute-' commands (*note Other::)
     output to a temporary buffer.  Otherwise, the output goes to the
     ESS process.

 - User Option: ess-eval-visibly-p
     Default: `nil'
     If non-`nil', then the `ess-eval-' commands (*note Edit buffer::)
     echo the S commands in the process buffer by default.  In any
     case, passing a prefix argument to the eval command reverses the
     meaning of this variable.


File: ess.info,  Node: Hooks,  Next: Keybindings,  Prev: Variables,  Up: Customization

Customizing ESS with hooks
==========================

   ESS provides the following hooks:

 - Hook: ess-mode-hook
     Called every time `ESS' is run.

 - Hook: ess-mode-load-hook
     Called just after the file `ess.el' is loaded.  Useful for setting
     up your keybindings, etc.

 - Hook: ess-pre-run-hook
     Called before the ESS process is started (e.g., with `M-x S').
     Good for setting up your directory.

 - Hook: ess-post-run-hook
     Called just after the ESS process starts up.  This can be used to
     evaluate ESS code at the start of a session, with
     `ess-eval-visibly', say.

 - Hook: inferior-ess-mode-hook
     For customizing inferior ess mode.  Called after inferior-ess-mode
     is entered and variables have been initialized.

 - Hook: ess-help-mode-hook
     Called every time when entering ess-help-mode (i.e., an ESS help
     buffer is generated).

 - Hook: ess-send-input-hook
     Called just before line input is sent to the process.

 - Hook: ess-transcript-mode-hook
     For customizing ESS transcript mode.


File: ess.info,  Node: Keybindings,  Prev: Hooks,  Up: Customization

Changing the default ESS keybindings
====================================

   ESS provides a separate keymaps (keymap variables) for ESS process
buffers, edit buffers and for help buffers.  The key bindings in the
edit buffers further depend on the language and dialect in use.

 - Keymap: inferior-ess-mode-map
     Keymap used in the ESS process buffer.  The bindings from
     `comint-mode-map' are automatically inherited.

 - Keymap: ess-mode-map
     Keymap used within edit (ess-mode) buffers.

 - Keymap: ess-eval-map
     Keymap used within edit buffers for sending ESS code to the running
     process.

 - Keymap: ess-help-mode-map
     Keymap used within help buffers.  In addition, `ess-help-sec-map'
     is the keymap for the `s' prefix key.  Keys defined in
     `ess-help-sec-keys-alist' are automatically inserted into this
     keymap when ESS is loaded.

 - Keymap: ess-transcript-mode-map
     Keymap used within ESS transcript buffers.
