The ESS environment is built on the open-source projects of
many contributors, dating back over 10 years.
Doug Bates and Ed Kademan wrote S-mode in 1989 to edit S and Splus
files in GNU Emacs.  Frank Ritter and Mike Meyer added features,
creating version 2.  Meyer and David Smith made further contributions,
creating version 3.  For version 4, David Smith provided process 
interaction based on Olin Shivers' comint package.

John Sall wrote GNU Emacs macros for SAS source code around 1990.
Tom Cook added more functionality creating SAS-mode which was
distributed in 1994.  Also in 1994, A.J. Rossini extended S-mode 
to support XEmacs.  Together with extensions written by Martin Maechler, 
this became version 4.7 and supported S, Splus, and R.
In 1995, Rossini extended SAS-mode to work with XEmacs.

In 1997, Rossini merged S-mode and SAS-mode into a single Emacs
package for statistical programming; the product of this marriage was
called ESS version 5.
