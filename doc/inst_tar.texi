@item
  cd to a directory where you keep emacs lisp files, or create a new
  directory to hold the distribution.  This directory will be referred
  to below as "the ESS distribution directory".  It will contain,
  at the end, the tar file ESS-5.1.4.tar.gz, and a directory for
  the ESS source, which will be termed "the ESS-5.1.4 source directory".
  Note that the .elc files may be installed elsewhere (as specified in the
  Makefile) if desired.
@item
  Retrieve the compressed tar file from one of the FTP or WWW archive
  sites via FTP (or HTTP).
@item
  Copy ESS-5.1.4.tar.gz to the location where you want the ESS-5.1.3
  directory, and cd there.  Extract the files from the distribution,
  which will unpack into a subdirectory, ESS-5.1.4.

	gunzip ESS-5.1.4.tar.gz
	tar vxf ESS-5.1.4.tar

	(or: gunzip < ESS-5.1.4.tar.gz | tar vxf - ).
	(or using GNU tar:  tar zvxf ESS-5.1.4.tar.gz).

  The tar command will extract files into the current directory.

  Do not create ESS-5.1.4 yourself, or you will get an extra level of
  depth to your directory structure.
@item
  Edit the file ess-site.el as explained in the comments section of
  that file.  Installations that are using ESS only for S-plus 3.x
  will probably not need to make any changes.  Installations that also
  have one or more of (S4 R SAS XLispStat Stata) will need to uncomment
  corresponding lines in ess-site.el.
@item
  READ THIS ITEM THOROUGHLY BEFORE STARTING:

  In the ESS-5.1.4 directory, edit the file Makefile (only if you want
  to place the executables in other locations; see LISPDIR and
  INFODIR) and then type:

	make
	make install

  This will install the info files (and the lisp files, if they
  are to go in another directory).  Don't forget to edit the file
  `dir' in the info directory specified by INFODIR in the Makefile.
  See the sample `dir' file for an example of the line to add.

  If you are using XEmacs, you might do:

	make EMACS=xemacs
	make EMACS=xemacs install

  instead of editing the Makefile.

  An alternative, if you are running XEmacs and have access to the
  XEmacs system directories, would be to place the directory in the
  site-lisp directory, and simply type "make"  (and copy the
  documentation as appropriate).

  For Emacs, you would still have to move the files into the top level
  site-lisp directory.
@item
  Add the line

	(load "/PATH/ess-site")

  to your .emacs file (or default.el or site-init.el, for a site-wide
  installation).  Replace `/PATH' above with the value of
  ess-lisp-directory as defined in ess-site.el.

  Alternatively, if ess-site.el is in your current Lisp path, you can
  do:

	(require 'ess-site)

  to configure Emacs for ESS.
@item
  (OPTIONAL) If you are running S-PLUS or R, you might consider
  installing the database files.  From within (X)Emacs, "C-x d" to the
  directory containing ESS.  Now:

       M-x S+3
  (get running.  once you have reached the SPLUS 3.x prompt, do:)
       M-x ess-create-object-name-db
  (this will create the file: ess-s+3-namedb.el; if it isn't in the
   ESS directory, move it there).

  Then, completions will be autoloaded and will not be regenerated for
  every session.

  For R:
      M-x R
  (get running.  once you have reached the R prompt, do:)
      M-x ess-create-object-name-db
  (this will create the file: ess-r-namedb.el; if it isn't in the
   ESS directory, move it there).
@item
  For more information on using ESS in your daily work, see the files
  README.S, README.SAS, and README.XLispStat.

  For the impatient, the quick version of usage follows:
@item
  To edit statistical programs, load the files with the requiste
  extensions  (".sas" for SAS, ".S" for S-PLUS, ".R" for R, and ".lsp"
  for XLispStat).
@item
  To run statistical processes under (X)Emacs:

  Run S-PLUS 3.x with:

	M-x S+3

  (or M-x S  using backwards compatibility).  You will then be asked
  for a pathname ("S starting data directory?"), from which to start
  the process.

  If you wish to run R, you can start it with:

	M-x R

  XLispStat can be run with

	M-x XLS

  SAS can be run with:

	M-x SAS

@item
  That's it!
