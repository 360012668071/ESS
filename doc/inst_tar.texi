We now discuss installation, which might happen under Unix or
Microsoft Windows.  First, we discuss Unix installation.  

Please skip to the next 


@enumerate 
@item
  cd to a directory where you keep emacs lisp files, or create a new
  directory to hold the distribution.  This directory will be referred
  to below as "the ESS distribution directory".  It will contain,
  at the end, the tar file @file{ESS-5.1.19.tar.gz}, and a directory for
  the ESS source, which will be termed "the ESS-5.1.19 source directory".

  Note that the .elc files may be installed elsewhere (as specified in the
  Makefile) if desired.
@item
  Retrieve the compressed tar file from one of the FTP or WWW archive
  sites via FTP (or HTTP).
@item
  Copy @file{ESS-5.1.19.tar.gz} to the location where you want the
  ESS-5.1.19 directory, and cd there.  Extract the files from the
  distribution, which will unpack into a subdirectory, ESS-5.1.19.
@example
	gunzip ESS-5.1.19.tar.gz
	tar vxf ESS-5.1.19.tar
@end example
	(or: @code{gunzip < ESS-5.1.19.tar.gz | tar vxf -} ).
	(or using GNU tar:  @code{tar zvxf ESS-5.1.19.tar.gz}).


  The @code{tar} command will extract files into the current directory.
  Do not create ESS-5.1.19 yourself, or you will get an extra level of
  depth to your directory structure.

  Note if you have a very ancient version of GNU emacs (@emph{and}  really
  can not upgrade to Emacs 20 or higher!) you can unpack the
  @file{lisp/19.29.tar.gz} file, read the ensuing @file{lisp/19.29/README}
  and you may succeed...

@item
  Edit the file @file{lisp/ess-site.el} as explained in the comments
  section of that file.  Installations that are using ESS only for S-plus
  3.x will probably not need to make any changes.  Installations that also
  have one or more of (S+5 S4 R SAS XLispStat Stata) may need to uncomment
  corresponding lines in @file{ess-site.el}.
@item
  @b{READ THIS ITEM THOROUGHLY BEFORE STARTING}:

  In the ESS-5.1.19 directory, edit the file @file{Makeconf} (only if you
  want to place the executables in other locations; see LISPDIR and
  INFODIR) and then type:
@example
	make
@end example

  If this works, then you might try:
@example
	make install
@end example
  Note that the latter does the former as well, so if you are feeling
  lucky, you might want to skip it.

  This will install the info files (and the lisp files, if they are to go
  in another directory).  Don't forget to edit the file @file{dir} in the
  info directory specified by @code{INFODIR} in @file{doc/Makefile}.  See
  the sample @file{dir} file for an example of the line to add.

  If you are using XEmacs, you might do:
@example
	make EMACS=xemacs
@end example

  and then
@example
	make EMACS=xemacs install
@end example
  instead of editing the Makefile.

  @emph{Note} that you might need to use @b{GNU make} for everything to
  work properly

  An alternative, if you are running XEmacs and have access to the
  XEmacs system directories, would be to place the directory in the
  site-lisp directory, and simply type @code{make} (and copy the
  documentation as appropriate).

  For Emacs, you would still have to move the files into the top level
  site-lisp directory.
@item
  Add the line
@example
  (load "/PATH/ess-site")
@end example
  to your .emacs file (or default.el or site-init.el, for a site-wide
  installation).  Replace `/PATH' above with the value of
  ess-lisp-directory as defined in ess-site.el.

  Alternatively, if ess-site.el is in your current Lisp path, you can
  do:
@example
	(require 'ess-site)
@end example
  to configure Emacs for ESS.
@item
  (OPTIONAL) If you are running S-PLUS or R, you might consider
  installing the database files.  From within (X)Emacs, @code{C-x d} to the
  directory containing ESS.  Now:
@example
       M-x S+3
@end example
  (or @code{M-x S+5}: get running.  once you have reached the SPLUS
  prompt, do:) 
@example
       M-x ess-create-object-name-db
@end example
  (this will create the file @file{ess-s+3-namedb.el}; if it isn't in the
   ESS directory, move it there).

  Then, completions will be autoloaded and will not be regenerated for
  every session.

  For R, do the same, using
@example
      M-x R
@end example
  and then @code{M-x ess-create-object-name-db} creating
  @file{ess-r-namedb.el}; if it isn't in the ESS directory, move it there).
@item
  For more information on using ESS in your daily work, see the files
  README.S, README.SAS, and README.XLispStat.

  For the impatient, the quick version of usage follows:
@item
  To edit statistical programs, load the files with the requiste
  extensions  (".sas" for SAS, ".S" for S-PLUS, ".R" for R, and ".lsp"
  for XLispStat).
@item
  To run statistical processes under (X)Emacs:

  Run S-PLUS 3.x with:
@example
	M-x S+3
@end example
  (or M-x S  using backwards compatibility).  You will then be asked
  for a pathname ("S starting data directory?"), from which to start
  the process.  Similarly for S-PLUS 5.x.

  If you wish to run R, you can start it with:
@example
	M-x R
@end example

  XLispStat can be run with
@example
	M-x XLS
@end example

  SAS can be run with:
@example
	M-x SAS
@end example


@item
  That's it!
@end enumerate


For @b{Microsoft Windows installation}, please follow the next steps:
(see separate instructions above for UNIX)

@enumerate

@item

   cd to a directory where you keep emacs lisp files, or create a new
   directory (for example, @file{c:\emacs\}) to hold the distribution.  This
   directory will be referred to below as "the ESS distribution
   directory".  It will contain, at the end, either the tar file
   @file{ESS-5.1.19.tar.gz} or the zip file @file{ESS-5.1.19.zip}, and a
   directory 
   for the ESS source, which will be termed "the ESS-5.1.19 source
   directory".

@item

     Retrieve the compressed tar file @file{ESS-5.1.19.tar.gz} or the
     zipped file @file{ESS-5.1.19.zip} from one of the FTP or WWW
     archive sites 
     via FTP (or HTTP).  Be aware that http browsers on Windows
     frequently change the "." and "-" characters in filenames to other
     punctuation.  Please change the names back to their original form.

@item

     Copy @file{ESS-5.1.19.tar.gz} to the location where you want the
     ESS-5.1.19 directory, for example to
     @file{c:\emacs\ESS-5.1.19.tar.gz}, and cd there.  For example,

        @example
             cd c:\emacs
        @end example

     Extract the files from the distribution, which will unpack
     into a subdirectory, @file{ess-5.1.19}.
        @example
          	gunzip ESS-5.1.19.tar.gz
          	tar vxf ESS-5.1.19.tar
        @end example
     	(or: @code{gunzip < ESS-5.1.19.tar.gz | tar vxf -} ).
        (or: from the zip file: @code{unzip ESS-5.1.19.zip})

     The @code{tar} command will extract files into the current directory.

     Do not create @file{ess-5.1.19} yourself, or you will get an extra level
     of   depth to your directory structure.

@item
     Windows users will usually be able to use the `lisp/ess-site.el'
     as distributed.  Only rarely will changes be needed.
@item

     Windows users will need to make sure that the directories for the
     software they will be using is in the PATH environment variable.  On
     Windows 9x, add lines similar to the following to your
     @file{c:\autoexec.bat} 
     file:
        @example
         path=%PATH%;c:\progra~1\spls2000\cmd
        @end example
     On Windows NT/2000, add the directories to the PATH using the
     MyComputer menu.  Note that the directory containing the program is
     added to the PATH, not the program itself.  One such line is needed
     for each software program.  Be sure to use the abbreviation
     @code{progra~1} and not the long version with embedded blanks.  Use
     backslashes "\".

@item

     Add the line 
        @example        
            (load "/PATH/ess-site")
        @end example
     to your .emacs (or _emacs) file (or default.el or site-init.el, for
     a site-wide installation).  Replace @code{/PATH} above with the
     value of ess-lisp-directory as defined in @file{ess-site.el}.  Use
     forwardslashes @code{/}.

@item

     (OPTIONAL) If you are running Sqpe or R, you might consider
     installing the database files.  From within (X)Emacs, @code{C-x d} to
     the   directory containing ESS.  Now:
        @example
                 M-x Sqpe+4
        @end example
       (get running.  once you have reached the SPLUS prompt, do:)
        @example
                 M-x ess-create-object-name-db
        @end example
       (this will create the file @file{ess-s+4-namedb.el}; if it isn't in the
       ESS directory, move it there).

     Then, completions will be autoloaded and will not be regenerated
     for every session.

     For R, do the same, using
        @example
                M-x R
        @end example
     and then @code{M-x ess-create-object-name-db} creating
     @file{ess-r-namedb.el}; if it isn't in the ESS directory, move it
     there).

@item

     For more information on using ESS in your daily work, see the
     files doc/README.SPLUS4WIN, doc/README.S, doc/README.SAS, and
     doc/README.XLispStat.

     For the impatient, the quick version of usage follows:
@item

     To edit statistical programs, load the files with the requisite
     extensions  (".sas" for SAS, ".S" or "s" or "q" or "Q" for S-PLUS,
     ".r" or ".R" for R, and ".lsp"   for XLispStat).
@item

     To run statistical processes under (X)Emacs:

     Run S-PLUS 4.x or 2000 with:
        @example
          	M-x S+4
        @end example
       (or @code{M-x S}).  You will then be
     asked for a pathname ("S starting data directory?"), from which to
     start the process.  The prompt will propose your current directory
     as the default.  Similarly for S-PLUS 6.x.  Send lines or regions
     from the emacs buffer containing your S program (for example,
     @file{myfile.s}) to the S-Plus Commands Window with the 
     @code{C-c C-n} or @code{C-c C-r} keys.

     Run S-PLUS 4.x or 2000 inside an emacs buffer
        @example
          	M-x Sqpe+4
        @end example
     You will then be asked for a pathname ("S starting data
     directory?"), from which to start the process.  The prompt will
     propose your current directory as the default.  Similarly for S-PLUS
     6.x.  Send lines or regions from the emacs buffer containing your S
     program (for example, @file{myfile.s}) to the *S+4* buffer with the
     @code{C-c C-n} or @code{C-c C-r} keys.  You do not have access to
     interactive graphics in 
     this mode.  You get Unix-like behavior, in particular the entire
     transcript is available for emacs-style search commands.

     If you wish to run R, you can start it with:
        @example
          	M-x R
        @end example

     XLispStat can not currently be run with
        @example
          	M-x XLS
        @end example
     Hopefully, this will change.  However, you can still edit with
     Emacs, and cut and paste the results into the XLispStat
     *Listener* Window under Microsoft Windows.

     SAS for Windows uses the batch access with function keys that is
     described in @file{doc/README.SAS}.

     SAS for Windows @b{cannot} be run with:
        @example
          	M-x SAS
        @end example
     Reason:  we use ddeclient to interface with programs and SAS doesn't
     provide the corresponding ddeserver capability.

@item That's it!
