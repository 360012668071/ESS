Annoucing the release of ESS-5.1.20 (Emacs Speaks Statistics).
-------------------------------------------------------------

ESS is an Emacs package which provides a standard interface between
statistical programs and statistical processes.  It is intended to
provide assistance for interactive statistical programming and data
analysis, and was is based on and extends the capabilities of S-mode.

The code is freely available but is not in the public domain.  It is
distributed under the GNU GPL.  Please read the file COPYING which comes
with the distribution, for more information about the license.

For more detailed information about ESS's abilities, please read the
file README with the distribution.

And to help remove any further confusion:

	The name is ESS, NOT ESS-mode.

Thank you :-).
