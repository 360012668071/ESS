<P>Note

 that you must have <TT>`custom'</TT> support.  It is available at 
 <A HREF="http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~abraham/custom/">The Custom Library</A>.
 These releases of emacs are no longer supported, so an upgrade is
 recommended if you plan to use ESS.  If you have GNU Emacs 19.29, 
 see See section <A HREF="ess_2.html#SEC8">Unix installation</A>.

<P>The variable <CODE>ess-change-sp-regex</CODE> is a regular
expression matching commands which change the search list.  You will
need to modify this variable if you have defined custom commands (other
than <CODE>attach</CODE>, <CODE>detach</CODE>, <CODE>collection</CODE> or <CODE>library</CODE>)
which modify the search list.
