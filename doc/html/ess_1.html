<H1><A NAME="SEC1" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC1">Introduction to <B>ESS</B></A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1"></A>


<P>
The S family (<B>S</B>, Splus and R) and SAS statistical analysis packages
provide sophisticated statistical and graphical routines for manipulating 
data.   <B>E</B>macs <B>S</B>peaks <B>S</B>tatistics (ESS) is based on the merger 
of two pre-cursors, S-mode and SAS-mode, which provided support for the
S family and SAS respectively.  Later on, Stata-mode was also incorporated.


<P>
ESS provides a common, generic, and useful interface, through emacs, to 
many statistical packages.  It currently supports the S family, SAS, BUGS, 
Stata and XLisp-Stat with the level of support roughly in that order.


<P>
A bit of notation before we begin.  <EM>emacs</EM> refers to both
<EM>GNU Emacs</EM> by the Free Software Foundation, as well as
<EM>XEmacs</EM> by the XEmacs Project.  The emacs major
mode <CODE>ESS[language]</CODE>, where <CODE>language</CODE> can take values such as 
<CODE>S</CODE>, <CODE>SAS</CODE>, or <CODE>XLS</CODE>.  The inferior process interface 
(the connection between emacs and the running process) referred to as inferior ESS
(<CODE>iESS</CODE>), is denoted in the modeline by <CODE>ESS[dialect]</CODE>, where
<CODE>dialect</CODE> can take values such as <CODE>S3</CODE>, <CODE>S4</CODE>, <CODE>S+3</CODE>,
<CODE>S+4</CODE>, <CODE>S+5</CODE>, <CODE>S+6</CODE>, <CODE>R</CODE>, <CODE>XLS</CODE>, <CODE>VST</CODE>, <CODE>SAS</CODE>.


<P>
Currently, the documentation contains many references to <CITE>`S'</CITE>
where actually any supported (statistics) language is meant, i.e., `S'
could also mean `XLisp-Stat' or `SAS'.


<P>
<A NAME="IDX2"></A>


<P>
<A NAME="IDX3"></A>
For exclusively interactive users of S, ESS provides a number of
features to make life easier.  There is an easy to use command history
mechanism, including a quick prefix-search history.  To reduce typing,
command-line completion is provided for all <B>S</B> objects and "hot
keys" are provided for common <B>S</B> function calls.  Help files are
easily accessible, and a paging mechanism is provided to view them.
Finally, an incidental (but very useful) side-effect of ESS is that a
transcript of your session is kept for later saving or editing.


<P>
<A NAME="IDX4"></A>
No special knowledge of Emacs is necessary when using <B>S</B>
interactively under ESS.


<P>
<A NAME="IDX5"></A>
For those that use <B>S</B> in the typical edit--test--revise cycle when
programming <B>S</B> functions, ESS provides for editing of <B>S</B> functions
in Emacs edit buffers.  Unlike the typical use of <B>S</B> where the editor
is restarted every time an object is edited, ESS uses the current Emacs
session for editing.  In practical terms, this means that you can edit
more than one function at once, and that the <B>ESS</B> process is still
available for use while editing.  Error checking is performed on
functions loaded back into S, and a mechanism to jump directly to the
error is provided.  ESS also provides for maintaining text versions of
your <B>S</B> functions in specified source directories.

<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC2">Why should I use ESS?</A></H2>

<P>
S is a powerful system for manipulating and analyzing data, but its user
interface -- particularly on Unix platforms -- leaves something to be
desired.  ESS is a package which is designed to make <B>S</B> easier to
use.


<P>
ESS provides several features which make it easier to interact with the
<B>ESS</B> process (i.e. enter commands and view the output).  These
include:



<UL>
<LI>

<B>Command-line editing</B> for fixing mistakes in commands before they are
entered.  The <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP> flag for S-plus provides something similar to
this, but here you have the full range of Emacs commands rather than a
limited subset.  However, other packages such as XLisp-Stat and S3 do not
necessarily have features like this built-in.
See section <A HREF="ess_7.html#SEC40">Entering commands and fixing mistakes</A>.

<LI>

<B>Searchable command history</B> for recalling previously-submitted
commands.  This provides all the features of the <SAMP>`Splus -e'</SAMP> history
mechanism, plus added features such as history searching.
See section <A HREF="ess_7.html#SEC48">Command History</A>.

<LI>

<B>Command-line completion</B> of both object and file names for quick
entry.  This is similar to <CODE>tcsh</CODE>'s facility for filenames; here it
also applies to object names and list components.
See section <A HREF="ess_7.html#SEC41">Completion of object names</A>.

<LI>

<B>Hot-keys</B> for quick entry of commonly-used commands in `S' such as
<CODE>objects()</CODE> and <CODE>search()</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="ess_7.html#SEC50">Hot keys for common commands</A>.

<LI>

<B>Transcript recording</B> for a complete record of all the actions in an
S session.
See section <A HREF="ess_7.html#SEC43">Manipulating the transcript</A>.

<LI>

<B>Interface to the help system</B>, with a specialized mode for viewing S
help files.
See section <A HREF="ess_9.html#SEC62">Reading help files in ESS</A>.

</UL>

<P>
If you commonly create or modify <B>S</B> functions, you will have found
the standard facilities for this (the <SAMP>`fix()'</SAMP> function, for
example) severely limiting.  Using S's standard features, one can only
edit one function at a time, and you can't continue to use <B>S</B> while
editing.  ESS corrects these problems by introducing the following
features:



<UL>
<LI>

<B>Object editing</B>.  ESS allows you to edit more than one function
simultaneously in dedicated Emacs buffers.  The <B>ESS</B> process may
continue to be used while functions are being edited.
See section <A HREF="ess_8.html#SEC54">Creating or modifying <B>S</B> objects</A>.

<LI>

<B>A specialized editing mode</B> for <B>S</B> code, which provides syntactic
indentation and highlighting.
See section <A HREF="ess_8.html#SEC58">Indenting and formatting <B>S</B> code</A>.

<LI>

<B>Facilities for loading and error-checking source files</B>, including a
keystroke to jump straight to the position of an error in a source file.
See section <A HREF="ess_8.html#SEC56">Detecting errors in source files</A>.

<LI>

<B>Source code revision maintenance</B>, which allows you to keep historic
versions of <B>S</B> source files.
See section <A HREF="ess_8.html#SEC60">Maintaining <B>S</B> source files</A>.

<LI>

<B>Facilities for evaluating <B>S</B> code</B> such as portions of source
files, or line-by-line evaluation of files (useful for debugging).
See section <A HREF="ess_8.html#SEC57">Sending code to the <B>ESS</B> process</A>.
</UL>

<P>
Finally, ESS provides features for re-submitting commands from saved
transcript files, including:



<UL>

<LI>

<B>Evaluation of previously entered commands</B>, stripping away
unnecessary prompts.
See section <A HREF="ess_7.html#SEC46">Re-submitting commands from the transcript</A>.

</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Minor more Makefile clean up.

</UL>

<P>
Changes/New Features in 5.1.22:

<UL>
<LI>Besides info documentation, PDF and HTML

documentation are also provided (instead of built using "make") and available
on the web as well; see <A HREF="http://software.biostat.washington.edu/ess/doc">ESS web page</A> and <A HREF="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/general/ESS/doc">StatLib</A>
<LI>Now that info documentation is available, the

README.* files are no longer supported.  However, they
are still distributed for what it's worth.
<LI>ESS is now an XEmacs package!  See

<A HREF="http://www.xemacs.org/Install/index.html">XEmacs Installation HOWTO</A>
for details (specifically, items 10-15).
<LI>ESS[SAS]: more user-friendly enhancements for remote

SAS batch jobs with Kermit file transfers (LOG and OUTPUT
function key features now supported).  Multiple shells
now supported so you can run SAS on different computers
from different buffers by setting the buffer-local variable
ess-sas-shell-buffer to unique buffer names.
<LI>Major re-vamping of Makefile/Makeconf.

</UL>

<P>
Changes/New Features in 5.1.21:

<UL>
<LI>ESS[SAS]: info documentation now available!, see

ESS-&#62;Help for SAS; F12 opens GSASFILE nearest point for viewing
either within emacs, when available, or via an external viewer;
more syntax highlighting keywords; more enhancements for remote
SAS batch jobs with Kermit; new framework for remote SAS interactive
jobs, see ess-remote
<LI>ESS[S]: info documentation now available!, see

ESS-&#62;Help for the S family
<LI>Makefile: tag now independent of rel; info files

made by doc/Makefile and installed in new info sub-directory
</UL>

<P>
Changes/New Features in 5.1.20:

<UL>
<LI>New `options()$STERM' in the S dialects (S, S-Plus, R).

The S program can determine the environment in which it is
currently running.  ESS sets the option to `iESS' or `ddeESS'
when it starts an S language process.  We recommend other specific
values for S language processes that ESS does not start.
<LI>New `ess-mouse-me' function, assigned to S-mouse-3 by default.

User may click on a word or region and then choose from the
menu to display the item, or a summary, or a plot, etc.
This feature is still under development.
<LI>GNU Emacs 21.1 is now supported (fixed for S dialects, SAS &#38; BUGS),

(some from Stephen Eglen).
<LI>XEmacs 21.x is now supported (fixed w32-using-nt bug)

<LI>XEmacs on Win (NT) is better supported.

<LI>Workaround for bug in Sqpe+6 (S-PLUS 6 for Win).

<LI>should now work even when imenu is not available (for old Xemacsen).

<LI>ESS[SAS]: XEmacs-Imenu fix; C-TAB is globalized along with your

function-key definitions, if specified; you can specify your SAS
library definitions outside of autoexec.sas for ess-sas-data-view
with SAS code placed in the variable ess-sas-data-view-libname,
also the dataset name is defaulted to the nearest permanent dataset
to point; Speedbar support now works for permanent datasets, please
ignore first./last.; new font-locking is now the default with more
improvements for font-locking PROCs, macro statements, * ; and %* ;
comments; you can toggle sas-log-mode with F10 which will font-lock
your .log (if it isn't too big); submit remote .sas files accessed
with ange-ftp, EFS or Tramp (Kermit is experimental) by setting
ess-sas-submit-method to 'sh; ess-sas-submit-command and
ess-sas-submit-command-options are buffer-local so you can have
local file variable sections at the end of your .sas files to
request different executables or specify special options and the
local file variables are re-read at submit instead of only at file
open so that if you make a change it is picked up immediately;
<LI>ESS[BUGS]: font-lock with `in' fixed.

<LI>for STATA: font-lock bug fixed.

<LI>for Rd mode: C-c C-v and `switch-process' in menu.

further, C-c C-f prefix (Rd-font) for inserting or surrounding a word
by things such as \code{.}, \code{\link{.}}, \emph{.} etc.
<LI>new functions (ess-directory-function) and (ess-narrow-to-defun)

ess-directory &#60;-&#62; default-directory logic (Jeff Mincy).
<LI>Re-organized Makefile and fixed a few bugs.

are replaced by .bmd and .bog to avoid emacs extension collisions).
Substitution" parameters facilitate "automagic" generation of
data...in" and "init...in" filenames, "const N=" from your data
file and "monitor()/stats()" commands.  Activated by pressing F12.
<LI>Fixes for `ess-smart-underscore' SAS breakage (Rich Heiberger)

<P>
Changes/New Features in 5.1.2:

<UL>
<LI>able to use inferior iESS mode to

communicate directly with a running S-Plus 4.x process using the
Microsoft DDE protocol.  We use the familiar (from Unix ESS) C-c C-n
and related key sequences to send lines from the S-mode file to the
inferior S process.  We continue to edit S input files in ESS[S] mode
and transcripts of previous S sessions in ESS Transcript mode.  All
three modes know the S language, syntax, and indentation patterns and
provide the syntactic highlighting that eases the programming tasks.

<P>
The ESS environment is built on the open-source projects of
many contributors, dating back over 10 years.
Doug Bates and Ed Kademan wrote S-mode in 1989 to edit S and Splus
files in GNU Emacs.  Frank Ritter and Mike Meyer added features,
creating version 2.  Meyer and David Smith made further contributions,
creating version 3.  For version 4, David Smith provided process 
interaction based on Olin Shivers' comint package.


<P>
John Sall wrote GNU Emacs macros for SAS source code around 1990.
Tom Cook added more functionality creating SAS-mode which was
distributed in 1994.  Also in 1994, A.J. Rossini extended S-mode 
to support XEmacs.  Together with extensions written by Martin Maechler, 
this became version 4.7 and supported S, Splus, and R.
In 1995, Rossini extended SAS-mode to work with XEmacs.


<P>
In 1997, Rossini merged S-mode and SAS-mode into a single Emacs
package for statistical programming; the product of this marriage was
called ESS version 5.
