<UL>
<LI>

Commands like <CODE>ess-display-help-on-object</CODE> and list completion
cannot be used while the user is entering a multi-line command.  The
only real fix in this situation is to use another <B>ESS</B> process.

<LI>

The <CODE>ess-eval-</CODE> commands can leave point in the <B>ESS</B> process
buffer in the wrong place when point is at the same position as the last
process output.  This proves difficult to fix, in general, as we need to
consider all <EM>windows</EM> with <CODE>window-point</CODE> at the right place.

<LI>

It's possible to clear the modification flag (say, by saving the buffer)
with the edit buffer not having been loaded into S.

<LI>

Backup files can sometimes be left behind, even when
<CODE>ess-keep-dump-files</CODE> is <CODE>nil</CODE>.

<LI>

Passing an incomplete <B>S</B> expression to <CODE>ess-execute</CODE> causes ESS
to hang.

<LI>

The function-based commands don't always work as expected on functions
whose body is not a parenthesized or compound expression, and don't even
recognize anonymous functions (i.e. functions not assigned to any
variable).

<LI>

Multi-line commands could be handled better by the command history
mechanism.

Please send bug reports, suggestions etc. to


<A HREF="mailto:ESS-bugs@stat.math.ethz.ch">
<P>
<A HREF="mailto:ESS-bugs@stat.math.ethz.ch">ESS-bugs@stat.math.ethz.ch</A>
</A>


<P>
The easiest way to do this is within Emacs by typing


<P>
<KBD>M-x ess-submit-bug-report</KBD>


<P>
This also gives the maintainers valuable information about your
installation which may help us to identify or even fix the bug.


<P>
Note that comments, suggestions, words of praise and large cash
donations are also more than welcome.




<H2><A NAME="SEC75" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC75">Mailing Lists</A></H2>

<P>
There is a mailing list for discussions and announcements relating to
ESS.  Join the list by sending an e-mail with "subscribe ess-help" (or
"help") in the body to <A HREF="mailto:ess-help-request@stat.math.ethz.ch">ess-help-request@stat.math.ethz.ch</A>;
contributions to the list may be mailed to
<A HREF="mailto:ess-help@stat.math.ethz.ch">ess-help@stat.math.ethz.ch</A>.  Rest assured, this is a fairly
low-volume mailing list.


<P>
The purposes of the mailing list include



<UL>
<LI>

 helping users of ESS to get along with it.
<LI>

 discussing aspects of using ESS on Emacs and XEmacs.
<LI>

 suggestions for improvements.
<LI>

 announcements of new releases of ESS.
<LI>

 posting small patches to ESS.
