<P>
<A NAME="IDX1"></A>


<P>
The <B>S</B> and Splus packages provide sophisticated statistical and
graphical routines for manipulating data.  S-mode, the package on which
ESS was based, provided a programming environment for data analysis and
statistical programming, as well as an intelligent interface to the S
process.


<P>
The <EM>ESS (:= <B>E</B>macs <B>S</B>peaks <B>S</B>tatistics)</EM> package is an
extension of S-mode to provide a common, generic, and useful interface,
through Emacs, to many statistical packages.  It has currently been
extended for R, XLisp-Stat, and SAS, with other statistical languages
such as Stata, SPSS, and Fiasco slated for implementations in the
future.


<P>
A bit of notation before we begin.  <EM>Emacs</EM> refers to both
<EM>Emacs</EM> as distributed by the Free Software Foundation, as well as
<EM>XEmacs</EM>, which is a second GNU version of Emacs.  The Emacs major
mode <CODE>ESS[language]</CODE> which is used for editing source for dialect
<CODE>language</CODE>, can take values <CODE>S</CODE>, <CODE>SAS</CODE>, or <CODE>XLS</CODE>,
for instance.  The inferior process interface (the connection between
Emacs and the running process) referred to as interactive ESS
(<CODE>iESS</CODE>), is denoted in the modeline by <CODE>ESS[dialect]</CODE>, where
<CODE>dialect</CODE> can take values <CODE>S3</CODE>, <CODE>S4</CODE>, <CODE>S+3</CODE>,
<CODE>S+4</CODE>, <CODE>S+5</CODE>, <CODE>S+6</CODE>,
<CODE>R</CODE>, <CODE>XLS</CODE>, <CODE>VST</CODE>, <CODE>SAS</CODE>, as well as others.


<P>
Currently, the documentation contains many references to <CITE>`S'</CITE>
where actually any supported (statistics) language is meant, i.e., `S'
could also mean `XLisp-Stat' or `SAS'.


<P>
<A NAME="IDX2"></A>


<P>
<A NAME="IDX3"></A>
For exclusively interactive users of S, ESS provides a number of
features to make life easier.  There is an easy to use command history
mechanism, including a quick prefix-search history.  To reduce typing,
command-line completion is provided for all <B>S</B> objects and "hot
keys" are provided for common <B>S</B> function calls.  Help files are
easily accessible, and a paging mechanism is provided to view them.
Finally, an incidental (but very useful) side-effect of ESS is that a
transcript of your session is kept for later saving or editing.


<P>
<A NAME="IDX4"></A>
No special knowledge of Emacs is necessary when using <B>S</B>
interactively under ESS.


<P>
<A NAME="IDX5"></A>
For those that use <B>S</B> in the typical edit--test--revise cycle when
programming <B>S</B> functions, ESS provides for editing of <B>S</B> functions
in Emacs edit buffers.  Unlike the typical use of <B>S</B> where the editor
is restarted every time an object is edited, ESS uses the current Emacs
session for editing.  In practical terms, this means that you can edit
more than one function at once, and that the <B>ESS</B> process is still
available for use while editing.  Error checking is performed on
functions loaded back into S, and a mechanism to jump directly to the
error is provided.  ESS also provides for maintaining text versions of
your <B>S</B> functions in specified source directories.




<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC2">Why should I use ESS?</A></H2>

<P>
S is a powerful system for manipulating and analyzing data, but its user
interface -- particularly on Unix platforms -- leaves something to be
desired.  ESS is a package which is designed to make <B>S</B> easier to
use.


<P>
ESS provides several features which make it easier to interact with the
<B>ESS</B> process (i.e. enter commands and view the output).  These
include:



<UL>
<LI>

<B>Command-line editing</B> for fixing mistakes in commands before they are
entered.  The <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP> flag for S-plus provides something similar to
this, but here you have the full range of Emacs commands rather than a
limited subset.  However, other packages such as XLisp-Stat and S3 do not
necessarily have features like this built-in.
See section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC13">Entering commands and fixing mistakes</A>.

<LI>

<B>Searchable command history</B> for recalling previously-submitted
commands.  This provides all the features of the <SAMP>`Splus -e'</SAMP> history
mechanism, plus added features such as history searching.
See section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC21">Command History</A>.

<LI>

<B>Command-line completion</B> of both object and file names for quick
entry.  This is similar to <CODE>tcsh</CODE>'s facility for filenames; here it
also applies to object names and list components.
See section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC14">Completion of object names</A>.

<LI>

<B>Hot-keys</B> for quick entry of commonly-used commands in `S' such as
<CODE>objects()</CODE> and <CODE>search()</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC23">Hot keys for common commands</A>.

<LI>

<B>Transcript recording</B> for a complete record of all the actions in an
S session.
See section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC16">Manipulating the transcript</A>.

<LI>

<B>Interface to the help system</B>, with a specialized mode for viewing S
help files.
See section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC35">Reading help files in ESS</A>.

</UL>

<P>
If you commonly create or modify <B>S</B> functions, you will have found
the standard facilities for this (the <SAMP>`fix()'</SAMP> function, for
example) severely limiting.  Using S's standard features, one can only
edit one function at a time, and you can't continue to use <B>S</B> while
editing.  ESS corrects these problems by introducing the following
features:



<UL>
<LI>

<B>Object editing</B>.  ESS allows you to edit more than one function
simultaneously in dedicated Emacs buffers.  The <B>ESS</B> process may
continue to be used while functions are being edited.
See section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC27">Creating or modifying <B>S</B> objects</A>.

<LI>

<B>A specialized editing mode</B> for <B>S</B> code, which provides syntactic
indentation and highlighting.
See section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC31">Indenting and formatting <B>S</B> code</A>.

<LI>

<B>Facilities for loading and error-checking source files</B>, including a
keystroke to jump straight to the position of an error in a source file.
See section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC29">Detecting errors in source files</A>.

<LI>

<B>Source code revision maintenance</B>, which allows you to keep historic
versions of <B>S</B> source files.
See section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC33">Maintaining <B>S</B> source files</A>.

<LI>

<B>Facilities for evaluating <B>S</B> code</B> such as portions of source
files, or line-by-line evaluation of files (useful for debugging).
See section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC30">Sending code to the <B>ESS</B> process</A>.
</UL>

<P>
Finally, ESS provides features for re-submitting commands from saved
transcript files, including:



<UL>

<LI>

<B>Evaluation of previously entered commands</B>, stripping away
unnecessary prompts.
See section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC19">Re-submitting commands from the transcript</A>.

</UL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC3">New features in ESS</A></H2>

<P>
Changes/New Features in 5.2.0:

<UL>
<LI>Stable release.  Final release of the 5.x series

(except for necessary bug-fixes).  Next release will be 
6.0 which will be a radical departure.
<LI>Now that info documentation is available, the

README.* files are no longer supported.  However, they
are still distributed for what it's worth.
<LI>ESS is now an XEmacs package!  See

<A HREF="http://www.xemacs.org/Install/index.html">XEmacs Installation HOWTO</A> 
for details (specifically, items 10-15).
<LI>ESS[SAS]: more user-friendly enhancements for remote

SAS batch jobs with Kermit file transfers (LOG and OUTPUT
function key features now supported).
</UL>

<P>
Changes/New Features in 5.1.21:

<UL>
<LI>ESS[SAS]: info documentation now available!, see

ESS-&#62;Help for Statistical Packages-&#62;Help for SAS; F12 opens
GSASFILE nearest point for viewing either within emacs, when
available, or via an external viewer; more syntax highlighting
keywords; more enhancements for remote SAS batch jobs with 
Kermit; new framework for remote SAS interactive jobs, see
ess-remote
<LI>ESS[S]: info documentation now available!, see

ESS-&#62;Help for Statistical Packages-&#62;Help for the S family
<LI>Makefile: tag now independent of rel; info files

made by doc/Makefile and installed in new info sub-directory
</UL>

<P>
Changes/New Features in 5.1.20:

<UL>
<LI>New `options()$STERM' in the S dialects (S, S-Plus, R).

The S program can determine the environment in which it is
currently running.  ESS sets the option to `iESS' or `ddeESS'
when it starts an S language process.  We recommend other specific
values for S language processes that ESS does not start.
<LI>New `ess-mouse-me' function, assigned to S-mouse-3 by default.

User may click on a word or region and then choose from the
menu to display the item, or a summary, or a plot, etc.
This feature is still under development.
<LI>GNU Emacs 21.1 is now supported (fixed for S dialects, SAS &#38; BUGS),

(some from Stephen Eglen).
<LI>XEmacs 21.x is now supported (fixed w32-using-nt bug)

<LI>XEmacs on Win (NT) is better supported.

<LI>Workaround for bug in Sqpe+6 (S-PLUS 6 for Win).

<LI>should now work even when imenu is not available (for old Xemacsen).

<LI>ESS[SAS]: XEmacs-Imenu fix; C-TAB is globalized along with your

function-key definitions, if specified; you can specify your SAS
library definitions outside of autoexec.sas for ess-sas-data-view
with SAS code placed in the variable ess-sas-data-view-libname, 
also the dataset name is defaulted to the nearest permanent dataset 
to point; Speedbar support now works for permanent datasets, please 
ignore first./last.; new font-locking is now the default with more 
improvements for font-locking PROCs, macro statements, * ; and %* ; 
comments; you can toggle sas-log-mode with F10 which will font-lock 
your .log (if it isn't too big); submit remote .sas files accessed
with ange-ftp, EFS or Tramp (Kermit is experimental) by setting 
ess-sas-submit-method to 'sh; ess-sas-submit-command and 
ess-sas-submit-command-options are buffer-local so you can have
local file variable sections at the end of your .sas files to 
request different executables or specify special options and the 
local file variables are re-read at submit instead of only at file
open so that if you make a change it is picked up immediately;
<LI>ESS[BUGS]: font-lock with `in' fixed.

<LI>for STATA: font-lock bug fixed.

<LI>for Rd mode: C-c C-v and `switch-process' in menu.

further, C-c C-f prefix (Rd-font) for inserting or surrounding a word
by things such as \code{.}, \code{\link{.}}, \emph{.} etc.
<LI>new functions (ess-directory-function) and (ess-narrow-to-defun)

ess-directory &#60;-&#62; default-directory logic (Jeff Mincy).
<LI>Re-organized Makefile and fixed a few bugs.

<UL>
<LI>S+6 now supported (Tony Rossini (Unix) and Rich Heiberger (Windows))

<LI>New BUGS support through ESS[BUGS] mode (Rodney Sparapani)

Templates assist you in writing .bug and .cmd code (.cmd and .log
are replaced by .bmd and .bog to avoid emacs extension collisions).
Substitution" parameters facilitate "automagic" generation of
data...in" and "init...in" filenames, "const N=" from your data
file and "monitor()/stats()" commands.  Activated by pressing F12.
<LI>Fixes for `ess-smart-underscore' SAS breakage (Rich Heiberger)

<LI>You can change between PC and Unix, local and global SAS function-key

definitions interactively (Rich Heiberger)
<LI>C-Submit a highlighted region to SAS batch (Rodney Sparapani)

<LI>New and improved SAS syntax highlighting (Rodney Sparapani)

To get the new functionality, set ess-sas-run-make-regexp to nil.
Also available in .log files via F10.
<LI>Open a permanent SAS dataset for viewing via F9 (Rodney Sparapani)

You must have the library defined in autoexec.sas for it to work.
<LI>User-friendly defaults for `sas-program', `ess-sas-batch-pre-command'

and `ess-sas-batch-post-command' as well Customize support for these
and other ESS[SAS] variables (Rodney Sparapani)

sense that there is no more use of ess-vars, but that we need to
fix ess-cust) (AJ Rossini (<A HREF="mailto:rossini@u.washington.edu">rossini@u.washington.edu</A>))
<LI>Many small (and large) fixes/contributions (MMaechler,

(<A HREF="mailto:maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch">maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch</A>)).
<LI>addition of the "S-equal" variable and provide M-x ess-add-MM-keys

inferior S process.  We continue to edit S input files in ESS[S] mode
and transcripts of previous S sessions in ESS Transcript mode.  All
three modes know the S language, syntax, and indentation patterns and
provide the syntactic highlighting that eases the programming tasks.
</UL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC4">Authors of and contributors to ESS</A></H2>

<P>
ESS is based on Olin Shivers' excellent comint package (which is supplied
<A NAME="IDX6"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>
with version 19 of GNU Emacs).  The original version of ESS (then known
as `S-mode') was written by Doug Bates (<A HREF="mailto:bates@stat.wisc.edu">bates@stat.wisc.edu</A>) and
Ed Kademan (<A HREF="mailto:kademan@stat.wisc.edu">kademan@stat.wisc.edu</A>).  Frank Ritter
(<A HREF="mailto:ritter@psy.cmu.edu">ritter@psy.cmu.edu</A>) then merged this version with his own
S-mode mode to form <TT>`S.el'</TT> version 2.1.


<P>
Version 2.1 of <TT>`S.el'</TT> was then updated and expanded by David Smith
to form version 3.4.  This was then updated for Emacs 19 to create
version 4.  Most bugs have now been fixed (and several new ones
introduced) and many new features have been added.  Thanks must go to
the many people who have helped with the development of the present
version of ESS:

<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC5">Getting the latest version of ESS</A></H2>

<P>
The latest stable version of ESS is always available on the web at:
<A HREF="http://software.biostat.washington.edu/ess/">ESS web page</A> or
<A HREF="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/general/ESS/">StatLib</A>


<P>
The latest (no more than 24 hours behind the developers) version of
ESS can also be retrieved using anonymous cvs:


<P>
You need a cvs client (that works with your firewall, if any)


<P>
the repository name is
   <CODE>:pserver:anoncvs@software.biostat.washington.edu:/var/anoncvs</CODE>


<P>
using a command-line cvs client (i.e. on Unix or DOS), first type:
   <CODE>cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@software.biostat.washington.edu:/var/anoncvs login</CODE>


<P>
password is anoncvs

<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC6">How to read this manual</A></H2>

<P>
If ESS has already been installed on your system, the next chapter has
details on how to get started using <B>S</B> under ESS.


<P>
If you need to install ESS, read section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC68">Installing ESS on your system</A> for details on what
needs to be done before proceeding to the next chapter.


<P>
section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC73">Customizing ESS</A> provides details of user variables you can change to
customize ESS to your taste, but it is recommended that you defer this
section until you are more familiar with ESS.


<P>
Don't forget that this manual is not the only source of information
about ESS.  In particular, the mode-based online help (obtained by
pressing <KBD>C-h m</KBD> when in the process buffer, edit buffer or help
buffer) is quite useful.  However the best source of information is, as
always, experience -- try it out!

To start an <B>S</B> session, simply type <KBD>M-x S RET</KBD>, i.e. press
<KBD>ESC</KBD>, then <KBD>x</KBD>, then capital <KBD>S</KBD> and then the <KBD>RETURN</KBD>

<P>
Enter the name of the directory you wish to start <B>S</B> from (that is,
the directory you would have <CODE>cd</CODE>'d to before starting <B>S</B> from

<P>
You will then be popped into a buffer
<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
<A NAME="IDX17"></A>
with name <SAMP>`*S*'</SAMP> which will be used
for interacting with the <B>ESS</B> process, and you can start entering commands.




<H2><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC8">Running more than one <B>ESS</B> process</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX18"></A>


<P>
ESS allows you to run more than one <B>ESS</B> process simultaneously in the
same session.  Each process has a name and a number; the initial process
<A NAME="IDX19"></A>
(process 1) is simply named (using S-PLUS as an example) <SAMP>`S+3:1'</SAMP>.
The name of the process is shown in the mode line in square brackets
(for example, <SAMP>`[S+3:2]'</SAMP>); this is useful if the process buffer is
renamed.  Without a prefix argument, <KBD>M-x S</KBD> starts a new <B>ESS</B>
process, using the first available process number.  With a prefix
argument (for R), <KBD>C-u M-x R</KBD> allows for the specification of
command line options for the size of memory allocated to the R process,
for example.

You can switch to any active <B>ESS</B> process with the command <KBD>C-c

For the predecessor to ESS (S-mode 4.8), the initial process was not

ESS works with processes on remote computers as easily as with
processes on the local machine.  The recommended way to access a
statistical program on remote computer is to start it from a telnet or
ssh buffer and then connect ESS to that buffer.



<OL>
<LI>Start a new telnet or ssh buffer and connect to the remote computer.

<LI>Start the ESS process on the remote machine, for example with one of

the commands <SAMP>`Splus'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`R'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`sas -stdio'</SAMP>.

<LI>Enter the ESS command <SAMP>`M-x ess-remote'</SAMP>.  You will be prompted for

a program name.  Enter <SAMP>`sp6'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`r'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`sas'</SAMP> or another
valid name.  Your telnet process is now known to ESS.  All the usual
ESS commands (<SAMP>`C-c C-n'</SAMP> and its relatives) now work with the S
language processes.  For SAS you need to use a different command
<SAMP>`C-c i'</SAMP> (that is a regular <SAMP>`i'</SAMP>, not a <SAMP>`C-i'</SAMP>) to send
lines from your <TT>`myfile.sas'</TT> to the remote SAS process.
<SAMP>`C-c i'</SAMP> sends lines over invisibly and lets SAS display them
formatted correctly as in a SAS log file.

<LI>Graphics (interactive) on the remote machine.  If you run X11

(See section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC43">Using ESS with windowing devices</A>, X-windows)
on both the local and remote machines then you should be able to
display the graphs locally by setting the <SAMP>`DISPLAY'</SAMP> environment
variable appropriately.  Windows users can download <SAMP>`xfree86'</SAMP>
from cygwin.

<LI>Graphics (static) on the remote machine.

If you don't run X-windows on the local machine, then you can write
graphics to a file on the remote machine, and display the file in
a graphics viewer on the local machine.  Most statistical software can
write one or more of postscript, GIF, or JPEG files.
Depending on the versions of emacs and the operating system that you
are running, emacs itself may display <SAMP>`.gif'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`.jpg'</SAMP>
files.  Otherwise, a graphics file viewer will be needed.
Ghostscript/ghostview may be downloaded to display <SAMP>`.ps'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`.eps'</SAMP> files.  Viewers for GIF and JPEG are usually included with
operating systems.  See section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC63">ESS[SAS]--Function keys for batch processing</A>,
for more information on using the F12 key for displaying graphics files
with SAS.
</OL>

<P>
Should you or a colleague inadvertently start a statistical process in
an ordinary <SAMP>`*shell*'</SAMP> buffer, the <SAMP>`ess-remote'</SAMP> command can
be used to convert it to an ESS buffer and allow you to use the ESS
commands with it.


<P>
We have two older commands, now deprecated, for accessing ESS processes
on remote computers.
See section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC10">S+elsewhere and ess-elsewhere</A>.




<H2><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC10">S+elsewhere and ess-elsewhere</A></H2>

<P>
These commands are now deprecated.  We recommend <SAMP>`ess-remote'</SAMP>.


<P>
We have two versions of the elsewhere function.


<P>
<SAMP>`S+elsewhere'</SAMP> is specific for the S-Plus program.
The more general function <SAMP>`ess-elsewhere'</SAMP> is not as stable.



<OL>
<LI>Enter <SAMP>`M-x S+elsewhere'</SAMP>.

You will be prompted for a starting directory.  I usually give it my
project directory on the local machine, say  <SAMP>`~myname/myproject/'</SAMP>

Or enter <SAMP>`M-x ess-elsewhere'</SAMP>.  You will be prompted for an ESS
program and for a starting directory.  I usually give it my project
directory on the local machine, say <SAMP>`~myname/myproject/'</SAMP>

<LI>The <SAMP>`*S+3*'</SAMP> buffer will appear with a prompt from the

local operating system (the unix prompt on a unix workstation or with
cygwin bash on a PC, or the msdos prompt on a PC without bash).  emacs
may freeze because the cursor is at the wrong place.  Unfreeze it with
<SAMP>`C-g'</SAMP> then move the cursor to the end with <SAMP>`M-&#62;'</SAMP>.
With <SAMP>`S+elsewhere'</SAMP> the buffer name is based on the name of the ESS program.
<LI>Enter

<SAMP>`telnet myname@other.machine'</SAMP> (or <SAMP>`ssh myname@other.machine'</SAMP>).
You will be prompted for your password on the remote machine.
Use
<SAMP>`M-x send-invisible'</SAMP>
before typing the password itself.

<LI>Before starting the ESS process, type <SAMP>`stty -echo nl'</SAMP>

at the unix prompt.  The <SAMP>`-echo'</SAMP> turns off the echo, the
<SAMP>`nl'</SAMP> turns off the newline that you see as <SAMP>`^M'</SAMP>.

<LI>You are now talking to the unix prompt on the other machine in the

<SAMP>`*S+3*'</SAMP> buffer.  cd into the directory for the current project and start
the ESS process by entering
<SAMP>`Splus'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`R'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`sas -stdio'</SAMP>
as appropriate.  If you can login remotely to your Windows 2000, then
you should be able to run <SAMP>`Sqpe'</SAMP> on the Windows machine.  I haven't
tested this and noone has reported their tests to me.  You will not be
able to run the GUI through this text-only connection.

<LI>Once you get the S or R or SAS prompt, then you are completely connected.

All the <SAMP>`C-c C-n'</SAMP> and related commands work correctly in sending
commands from <SAMP>`myfile.s'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`myfile.r'</SAMP> on the PC to the
<SAMP>`*S+3*'</SAMP> buffer running the S or R or SAS program on the remote machine.

<LI>Graphics on the remote machine works fine.  If you run X-windows

graphics on the remote unix machine you should be able to display them
in <SAMP>`xfree86'</SAMP> on your PC.  If you don't run X-windows, then you can write
graphics to the postscript device and copy it to your PC with dired
and display it with ghostscript.

<H2><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC11">Changing the startup actions</A></H2>

<P>
If you do not wish ESS to prompt for a starting directory when starting
a new process, set the variable <CODE>ess-ask-for-ess-directory</CODE> to
<A NAME="IDX26"></A>
<CODE>nil</CODE>.  In this case, the value of the variable <CODE>ess-directory</CODE>
<A NAME="IDX27"></A>
is used as the starting directory.  The default value for this variable
is your home directory.  If <CODE>ess-ask-for-ess-directory</CODE> has a
non-<CODE>nil</CODE> value (as it does by default) then the value of
<CODE>ess-directory</CODE> provides the default when prompting for the
starting directory.  Incidentally, <CODE>ess-directory</CODE> is an ideal
variable to set in <CODE>ess-pre-run-hook</CODE>.


<P>
If you like to keep a records of your <B>S</B> sessions, set the variable
<CODE>ess-ask-about-transfile</CODE> to <CODE>t</CODE>, and you will be asked for a
filename for the transcript before the <B>ESS</B> process starts.


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>User Option:</U> <B>ess-ask-about-transfile</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX28"></A>
If non-<CODE>nil</CODE>, as for a file name in which to save the session

</DL>


<P>
<A NAME="IDX29"></A>
Enter the name of a file in which to save the transcript at the prompt.
If the file doesn't exist it will be created (and you should give it a
file name ending in <SAMP>`.St'</SAMP>; if the file already exists the
transcript will be appended to the file.  (Note: if you don't set this
variable but you still want to save the transcript, you can still do it
later -- see section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC20">Keeping a record of your <B>S</B> session</A>.)


<P>
Once these questions are answered (if they are asked at all) the S
process itself is started by calling the program name specified in the
variable <CODE>inferior-ess-program</CODE>.
<A NAME="IDX30"></A>
If you need to pass any arguments to this program, they may be specified
in the variable <CODE>inferior-<VAR>S_program_name</VAR>-args</CODE> (e.g. if
<CODE>inferior-ess-program</CODE> is <CODE>"S+"</CODE> then the variable to set is
<CODE>inferior-S+-args</CODE>.
<A NAME="IDX31"></A>
It is not normally necessary to pass arguments to the <B>S</B> program; in
particular do not pass the <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP> option to <CODE>Splus</CODE>, since ESS
provides its own command history mechanism.

<P>
The primary function of the ESS package is to provide an easy-to-use
front end to the <B>S</B> interpreter.  This is achieved by running the S
process from within an Emacs buffer, so that the Emacs editing commands
are available to correct mistakes in commands, etc.  The features of
Inferior <B>S</B> mode are similar to those provided by the standard Emacs
shell mode (see section `Shell Mode' in <CITE>The Gnu Emacs Reference Manual</CITE>).  Command-line completion of <B>S</B> objects and a number of `hot
keys' for commonly-used <B>S</B> commands are also provided for ease of
typing.




<H2><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC13">Entering commands and fixing mistakes</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX35"></A>


<P>
Sending a command to the <B>ESS</B> process is as simple as typing it in
and pressing the <KBD>RETURN</KBD> key:



<UL>
<LI>

<KBD>RET</KBD> (<CODE>inferior-ess-send-input</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX36"></A>
Send the command on the current line to the <B>ESS</B> process.
</UL>

<P>
If you make a typing error before pressing <KBD>RET</KBD> all the usual Emacs
editing commands are available to correct it (see section `Basic editing commands' in <CITE>The GNU Emacs Reference Manual</CITE>).  Once the
command has been corrected you can press <KBD>RETURN</KBD> (even if the
cursor is not at the end of the line) to send the corrected command to
the <B>ESS</B> process.


<P>
ESS provides some other commands which are useful for fixing mistakes:



<UL>
<LI>

<KBD>C-c C-w</KBD> (<CODE>backward-kill-word</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX37"></A>
Deletes the previous word (such as an object name) on the command line.

<LI>

<KBD>C-c C-u</KBD> (<CODE>comint-kill-input</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX38"></A>
Deletes everything from the prompt to point.  Use this to abandon a
command you have not yet sent to the <B>ESS</B> process.

<LI>

<KBD>C-c C-a</KBD> (<CODE>comint-bol</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX39"></A>
Move to the beginning of the line, and then skip forwards past the
prompt, if any.
</UL>

<P>
See section `Shell Mode' in <CITE>The Gnu Emacs Reference Manual</CITE>, for other
commands relevant to entering input.




<H2><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC14">Completion of object names</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX40"></A>
<A NAME="IDX41"></A>


<P>
In the process buffer, the <KBD>TAB</KBD> key is for completion, similar to
that provided by Shell Mode for filenames.  In Inferior <B>S</B> mode,
pressing the <KBD>TAB</KBD> key when the cursor is following the first few
characters of an object name <EM>completes</EM> the object name; if the
cursor is following a file name <KBD>TAB</KBD> completes the file name.



<UL>
<LI>

<KBD>TAB</KBD> (<CODE>comint-dynamic-complete</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX42"></A>
Complete the <B>S</B> object name or filename before point.
</UL>

<P>
When the cursor is just after a partially-completed object name,
pressing <KBD>TAB</KBD> provides completion in a similar fashion to
<CODE>tcsh</CODE>
<A NAME="IDX43"></A>
except that completion is performed over all known <B>S</B> object names
instead of file names.  ESS maintains a list of all objects known to S
at any given time, which basically consists of all objects (functions
and datasets) in every attached directory listed by the <CODE>search()</CODE>
command
<A NAME="IDX44"></A>
along with the component objects of attached data frames
<A NAME="IDX45"></A>
(if your version of <B>S</B> supports them).


<P>
For example, consider the three functions (available in Splus version
3.0) called <CODE>binomplot()</CODE>, <CODE>binom.test()</CODE> and
<CODE>binomial()</CODE>.  Typing <KBD>bin TAB</KBD> after the <B>S</B> prompt will
insert the characters <SAMP>`om'</SAMP>, completing the longest prefix
(<SAMP>`binom'</SAMP>) which distinguishes these three commands.  Pressing
<KBD>TAB</KBD> once more provides a list of the three commands which have
this prefix, allowing you to add more characters (say, <SAMP>`.'</SAMP>) which
specify the function you desire.  After entering more characters
pressing <KBD>TAB</KBD> yet again will complete the object name up to
uniqueness, etc.  If you just wish to see what completions exist without
adding any extra characters, type <KBD>M-?</KBD>.



<UL>
<LI>

<KBD>M-?</KBD> (<CODE>ess-list-object-name-completions</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX46"></A>
List all possible completions of the object name at point.
</UL>

<P>
ESS also provides completion over the components of named lists accessed
using the <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> notation, to any level of nested lists.  This feature
is particularly useful for checking what components of a list object
exist while partway through entering a command: simply type the object
name and <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> and press <KBD>TAB</KBD> to see the names of existing list
components for that object.
<A NAME="IDX47"></A>
<A NAME="IDX48"></A>


<P>
<A NAME="IDX49"></A>
Completion is also provided over file names, which is particularly
useful when using <B>S</B> functions such as <CODE>get()</CODE> or <CODE>scan()</CODE>
which require fully expanded file names.  Whenever the cursor is within
an <B>S</B> string, pressing <KBD>TAB</KBD> completes the file name before
point, and also expands any <SAMP>`~'</SAMP> or environment variable references.


<P>
If the cursor is not in a string and does not follow a (partial) object
name, the <KBD>TAB</KBD> key has a third use: it expands history references.
See section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC22">References to historical commands</A>.




<H2><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC15">Completion details</A></H2>

<P>
ESS automatically keeps track of any objects added or deleted to the
system (such as new objects created, or directories added to the search
list) to make completion as accurate as possible.  Whenever ESS notices
that search list has changed
<A NAME="IDX50"></A>
<A NAME="DOCF1" HREF="ess_foot.html#FOOT1">(1)</A>  when you attach a directory or data
frame, the objects associated with it immediately become available for a
completion; when it is detached completion is no longer available on
those objects.


<P>
To maintain a list of accessible objects for completion, ESS needs to
determine which objects are contained in each directory or data frame on
the search list.  This is done at the start of each <B>S</B> session, by
running the <CODE>objects()</CODE> command on every element of the search
list.  On some systems, however, this can be rather slow; it's doubly
frustrating when you consider that most of the directories on the search
list are the standard <B>S</B> libraries, which never change anyway!  When
ESS was installed, a database of the standard object names should have
been created which should speed up this process at the start of an S
session; if it has not been created you will get a warning like
`S-namedb.el does not exist'.  See section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC68">Installing ESS on your system</A>, for information on
how to create this database.


<P>
Efficiency in completion is gained by maintaining a cache of objects
currently known to S; when a new object becomes available or is deleted,
only one component of the cache corresponding to the associated
directory needs to be refreshed.  If ESS ever becomes confused about
what objects are available for completion (such as when if refuses to
complete an object you <STRONG>know</STRONG> is there), the command <KBD>M-x
ess-resynch</KBD>
<A NAME="IDX51"></A>
forces the <EM>entire</EM> cache to be refreshed, which should fix the
problem.




<H2><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC16">Manipulating the transcript</A></H2>

<P>
Most of the time, the cursor spends most of its time at the bottom of
the <B>ESS</B> process buffer, entering commands.  However all the input
and output from the current (and previous) <B>ESS</B> sessions is stored in
the process buffer (we call this the transcript) and often we want to
<A NAME="IDX52"></A>
move back up through the buffer, to look at the output from previous
commands for example.


<P>
Within the process buffer, a paragraph
<A NAME="IDX53"></A>
is defined as the prompt, the command after the prompt, and the output
from the command.  Thus <KBD>M-{</KBD> and <KBD>M-}</KBD> move you backwards and
forwards, respectively, through commands in the transcript.  A
particularly useful command is <KBD>M-h</KBD> (<CODE>mark-paragraph</CODE>) which
will allow you to mark a command and its entire output (for deletion,
perhaps).  For more information about paragraph commands,
see section `Paragraphs' in <CITE>The GNU Emacs Reference Manual</CITE>.


<P>
If an ESS process finishes and you restart it in the same process
buffer, the output from the new ESS process appears after the output
from the first ESS process separated by a form-feed (<SAMP>`^L'</SAMP>)
character.  Thus pages in the ESS
<A NAME="IDX54"></A>
process buffer correspond to ESS sessions.  Thus, for example, you may
use <KBD>C-x [</KBD> and <KBD>C-x ]</KBD> to move backward and forwards through
ESS sessions in a single ESS process buffer.  For more information about
page commands, see section `Pages' in <CITE>The GNU Emacs Reference Manual</CITE>.




<H3><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC17">Manipulating the output from the last command</A></H3>

<P>
Viewing the output of the command you have just entered is a common
occurrence and ESS provides a number of facilities for doing this.
Whenever a command produces a longish output, it is possible that the
window will scroll, leaving the next prompt near the middle of the
window.  The first part of the command output may have scrolled off the
top of the window, even though the entire output would fit in the window
if the prompt were near the bottom of the window.  If this happens, you
can use the command



<UL>
<LI>

<KBD>C-c C-e</KBD> (<CODE>comint-show-maximum-output</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX55"></A>
Move to the end of the buffer, and place cursor on bottom line of
window.
</UL>

<P>
to make more of the last output visible.  (To make this happen
automatically for all inputs, set the variable
<CODE>comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-input</CODE> to <CODE>t</CODE>; for information on
this and other options for handling process input and output
see section `Shell Mode Options' in <CITE>The GNU Emacs Reference Manual</CITE>.)


<P>
If the first part of the output is still obscured, use
<A NAME="IDX56"></A>

<UL>
<LI>

<KBD>C-c C-r</KBD> (<CODE>comint-show-output</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX57"></A>
Moves cursor to the previous command line and and places it at the top
of the window.
</UL>

<P>
to view it.  Finally, if you want to discard the last command output
altogether, use



<UL>
<LI>

<KBD>C-c C-o</KBD> (<CODE>comint-kill-output</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX58"></A>
<A NAME="IDX59"></A>
Deletes everything from the last command to the current prompt.
</UL>

<P>
to delete it.  Use this command judiciously to keep your transcript to a
more manageable size.




<H3><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC18">Viewing more historic commands</A></H3>

<P>
If you want to view the output from more historic commands than the
previous command, commands are also provided to move backwards and
forwards through previously entered commands in the process buffer:



<UL>
<LI>

<KBD>C-c C-p</KBD> (<CODE>comint-previous-input</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX60"></A>
Moves point to the preceding command in the process buffer.

<LI>

<KBD>C-c C-n</KBD> (<CODE>comint-next-input</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX61"></A>
Moves point to the next command in the process buffer.
</UL>

<P>
Note that these two commands are analogous to <KBD>C-p</KBD> and <KBD>C-n</KBD>
but apply to command lines rather than text lines.  And just like
<KBD>C-p</KBD> and <KBD>C-n</KBD>, passing a prefix argument to these commands
means to move to the <VAR>ARG</VAR>'th next (or previous) command.  (These
commands are also discussed in section `Shell History Copying' in <CITE>The GNU Emacs Reference Manual</CITE>.)


<P>
There are also two similar commands (not bound to any keys by default)
which move to preceding or succeeding commands, but which first prompt
for a regular expression (see section `Syntax of Regular Expression' in <CITE>The GNU Emacs Reference Manual</CITE>), and then moves to
the next (previous) command matching the pattern.


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>comint-backward-matching-input</B> <I>regexp arg</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX62"></A>

<DD><A NAME="IDX63"></A>
Search backward (forward) through the transcript buffer for the
<VAR>arg</VAR>'th previous (next) command matching <VAR>regexp</VAR>.  <VAR>arg</VAR>
is the prefix argument; <VAR>regexp</VAR> is prompted for in the minibuffer.
</DL>




<H3><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC19">Re-submitting commands from the transcript</A></H3>

<P>
When moving through the transcript, you may wish to re-execute some of
the commands you find there.  ESS provides three commands to do this;
these commands may be used whenever the cursor is within a command line
in the transcript (if the cursor is within some command <EM>output</EM>,
an error is signaled).  Note all three commands involve the <KBD>RETURN</KBD>
key.



<UL>
<LI>

<KBD>RET</KBD> (<CODE>inferior-ess-send-input</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX64"></A>
Copy the command under the cursor to the current command line, and
execute it.

<LI>

<KBD>C-c RET</KBD> (<CODE>comint-copy-old-input</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX65"></A>
Copy the command under the cursor to the current command line, but don't
execute it.  Leaves the cursor on the command line so that the copied
command may be edited.

<LI>

<KBD>M-RET</KBD> (<CODE>ess-transcript-send-command-and-move</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX66"></A>
Copy the command under the cursor to the current command line, and
execute it.  Moves the cursor to the following command.
</UL>

<P>
When the cursor is not after the current prompt, the <KBD>RETURN</KBD> key
has a slightly different behavior than usual.  Pressing <KBD>RET</KBD> on any
line containing a command that you entered (i.e. a line beginning with a
prompt) sends that command to the <B>ESS</B> process once again.  If you
wish to edit the command before executing it, use <KBD>C-c RET</KBD> instead;
it copies the command to the current prompt but does not execute it,
allowing you to edit it before submitting it.


<P>
These two commands leave the cursor at the new command line, allowing
you to continue with interactive use of S.  If you wish to resubmit a
series of commands from the transcript, consider using <KBD>M-RET</KBD>
instead, which leaves the cursor at the command line following the one
you re-submitted.  Thus by using <KBD>M-RET</KBD> repeatedly, you can
re-submit a whole series of commands.


<P>
These commands work even if if the current line is a continuation line
(i.e. the prompt is <SAMP>`+'</SAMP> instead of <SAMP>`&#62;'</SAMP>) -- in this case all
the lines that form the multi-line command are concatenated together and
the resulting command is sent to the <B>ESS</B> process (currently this is
the only way to resubmit a multi-line command to the <B>ESS</B> process in
one go).  If the current line does
<A NAME="IDX67"></A>
not begin with a prompt, an error is signaled.  This feature, coupled
with the command-based motion commands described above, could be used as
a primitive history mechanism.  ESS provides a more sophisticated
mechanism, however, which is described in section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC21">Command History</A>.




<H3><A NAME="SEC20" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC20">Keeping a record of your <B>S</B> session</A></H3>

<P>
To keep a record of your <B>S</B> session in a disk file, use the Emacs
command <KBD>C-x C-w</KBD> (<CODE>write-file</CODE>) to attach a file to the
<B>ESS</B> process buffer.  The name of the process buffer will (probably)
change to the name of the file, but this is not a problem.  You can
still use <B>S</B> as usual; just remember to save the file before you quit
Emacs with <KBD>C-x C-s</KBD>.  You can make ESS prompt you for a filename in
which to save the transcript every time you start <B>S</B> by setting the
variable
<A NAME="IDX68"></A>
<CODE>ess-ask-about-transfile</CODE> to <CODE>t</CODE>; see section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC11">Changing the startup actions</A>.
<A NAME="IDX69"></A>
We recommend you save your transcripts with filenames that end in
<SAMP>`.St'</SAMP>.  There is a special mode (ESS transcript mode ---
see section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC36">Manipulating saved transcript files</A>) for editing transcript files which is
automatically selected for files with this suffix.


<P>
<A NAME="IDX70"></A>
S transcripts can get very large, so some judicious editing is
appropriate if you are saving it in a file.  Use <KBD>C-c C-o</KBD> whenever
a command produces excessively long output (printing large arrays, for
example).  Delete erroneous commands (and the resulting error messages
or other output) by moving to the command (or its output) and typing
<KBD>M-h C-w</KBD>.  Also, remember that <KBD>C-c C-e</KBD> (and other hot keys)
may be used for commands whose output you do not wish to appear in the
transcript.  These suggestions are appropriate even if you are not
saving your transcript to disk, since the larger the transcript, the
more memory your Emacs process will use on the host machine.


<P>
Finally, if it is your intention to produce <B>S</B> source code (suitable
for using with <CODE>source()</CODE> or inclusion in an <B>S</B> function) from a
transcript, then the command <KBD>M-x ess-clean-region</KBD> may be of use.
<A NAME="IDX71"></A>
This command works in any Emacs buffer, and removes all prompts and
command output from an ESS transcript within the current region, leaving
only the commands.  Don't forget to remove any erroneous commands first!




<H2><A NAME="SEC21" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC21">Command History</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX72"></A>
<A NAME="IDX73"></A>
<A NAME="IDX74"></A>


<P>
ESS provides easy-to-use facilities for re-executing or editing previous
commands.  An input history of the last few commands is maintained (by
default the last 50 commands are stored, although this can be changed by
setting the variable <CODE>comint-input-ring-size</CODE> in
<A NAME="IDX75"></A>
<CODE>inferior-ess-mode-hook</CODE>.) The simplest history commands simply
select the next and previous commands in the input history:



<UL>
<LI>

<KBD>M-p</KBD> (<CODE>comint-previous-input</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX76"></A>
Select the previous command in the input history.

<LI>

<KBD>M-n</KBD>  (<CODE>comint-next-input</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX77"></A>
Select the next command in the input history.
</UL>

<P>
For example, pressing <KBD>M-p</KBD> once will re-enter the last command into
the process buffer after the prompt but does not send it to the <B>ESS</B>
process, thus allowing editing or correction of the command before the
<B>ESS</B> process sees it.  Once corrections have been made, press
<KBD>RET</KBD> to send the edited command to the <B>ESS</B> process.


<P>
If you want to select a particular command from the history by matching
it against a regular expression (see section `Syntax of Regular Expression' in <CITE>The GNU Emacs Reference Manual</CITE>), to search for a
particular variable name for example, these commands are also available:



<UL>
<LI>

<KBD>M-r</KBD> (<CODE>comint-previous-matching-input</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX78"></A>
Prompt for a regular expression, and search backwards through the input
history for a command matching the expression.

<LI>

<KBD>M-s</KBD> (<CODE>comint-next-matching-input</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX79"></A>
Prompt for a regular expression, and search backwards through the input
history for a command matching the expression.
</UL>

<P>
A common type of search is to find the last command that began with a
particular sequence of characters; the following two commands provide an
easy way to do this:



<UL>
<LI>

<KBD>A-M-r</KBD> (<CODE>comint-previous-matching-input-from-input</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX80"></A>
Select the previous command in the history which matches the string
typed so far.

<LI>

<KBD>A-M-s</KBD> (<CODE>comint-next-matching-input-from-input</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX81"></A>
Select the next command in the history which matches the string typed so
far.
</UL>

<P>
Instead of prompting for a regular expression to match against, as they
instead select commands starting with those characters already entered.
For instance, if you wanted to re-execute the last <CODE>attach()</CODE>
command, you may only need to type <KBD>att</KBD> and then <KBD>A-M-r</KBD> and
<KBD>RET</KBD>.  (Note: you may not have an <KBD>ALT</KBD> key on your keyboard,
in which case it may be a good idea to bind these commands to some other
keys.)


<P>
See section `Shell History Ring' in <CITE>The GNU Emacs Reference Manual</CITE>, for a more detailed discussion of the history mechanism.




<H2><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC22">References to historical commands</A></H2>

<P>
Instead of searching through the command history using the command
described in the previous section, you can alternatively refer to a
historical command directly using a notation very similar to that used
in <CODE>csh</CODE>.  History references are introduced by a <SAMP>`!'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`^'</SAMP> character and have meanings as follows:


<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`!!'</SAMP>
<DD>
The immediately previous command

<DT><SAMP>`!-<VAR>N</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
The <VAR>N</VAR>th previous command

<DT><SAMP>`!text'</SAMP>
<DD>
The last command beginning with the string <SAMP>`text'</SAMP>

<DT><SAMP>`!?text'</SAMP>
<DD>
The last command containing the string <SAMP>`text'</SAMP>
</DL>

<P>
In addition, you may follow the reference with a <EM>word designator</EM>
to select particular <EM>words</EM> of the input.  A word is defined as a
sequence of characters separated by whitespace.  (You can modify this
definition by setting the value of <CODE>comint-delimiter-argument-list</CODE>
to a list of characters that are allowed to separate words and
<A NAME="IDX82"></A>
themselves form words.)  Words are numbered beginning with zero.  The
word designator usually begins with a <SAMP>`:'</SAMP> (colon) character;
however it may be omitted if the word reference begins with a <SAMP>`^'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`$'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>.  If the word is to be selected from the
previous command, the second <SAMP>`!'</SAMP>  character can be omitted from the
event specification.  For instance, <SAMP>`!!:1'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`!:1'</SAMP> both
refer to the first word of the previous command, while <SAMP>`!!$'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`!$'</SAMP> both refer to the last word in the previous command.  The
format of word designators is as follows:


<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`0'</SAMP>
<DD>
The zeroth word (i.e. the first one on the command line)

<DT><SAMP>`<VAR>n</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
The <VAR>n</VAR>th word, where <VAR>n</VAR> is a number

<DT><SAMP>`^'</SAMP>
<DD>
The first word (i.e. the second one on the command line)

<DT><SAMP>`$'</SAMP>
<DD>
The last word

<DT><SAMP>`<VAR>x</VAR>-<VAR>y</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
A range of words; <SAMP>`-<VAR>y</VAR>'</SAMP> abbreviates <SAMP>`0-<VAR>y</VAR>'</SAMP>

<DT><SAMP>`*'</SAMP>
<DD>
All the words except the zeroth word, or nothing if the command had just
one word (the zeroth)

<DT><SAMP>`<VAR>x</VAR>*'</SAMP>
<DD>
Abbreviates <VAR>x</VAR>-$

<DT><SAMP>`<VAR>x</VAR>-'</SAMP>
<DD>
Like <SAMP>`<VAR>x</VAR>*'</SAMP>, but omitting the last word
</DL>

<P>
In addition, you may surround the entire reference except for the first
<SAMP>`!'</SAMP> by braces to allow it to be followed by other (non-whitespace)
characters (which will be appended to the expanded reference).


<P>
Finally, ESS also provides quick substitution; a reference like
<SAMP>`^old^new^'</SAMP> means "the last command, but with the first occurrence
of the string <SAMP>`old'</SAMP> replaced with the string <SAMP>`new'</SAMP>" (the last
<SAMP>`^'</SAMP> is optional).  Similarly, <SAMP>`^old^'</SAMP> means "the last
command, with the first occurrence of the string <SAMP>`old'</SAMP> deleted"
(again, the last <SAMP>`^'</SAMP> is optional).


<P>
To convert a history reference as described above to an input suitable
for S, you need to <EM>expand</EM> the history reference, using the
<KBD>TAB</KBD> key.  For this to work, the cursor must be preceded by a space
(otherwise it would try to complete an object name) and not be within a
string (otherwise it would try to complete a filename).  So to expand
the history reference, type <KBD>SPC TAB</KBD>.  This will convert the
history reference into an <B>S</B> command from the history, which you can
then edit or press <KBD>RET</KBD> to execute.


<P>
For example, to execute the last command that referenced the variable
<CODE>data</CODE>, type <KBD>!?data SPC TAB RET</KBD>.




<H2><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC23">Hot keys for common commands</A></H2>

<P>
ESS provides a number of commands for executing the commonly used
functions.  These commands below are basically information-gaining
commands (such as <CODE>objects()</CODE> or <CODE>search()</CODE>) which tend to
clutter up your transcript and for this reason some of the hot keys
display their output in a temporary buffer instead of the process buffer
by default.  This behavior is controlled by the variable
<CODE>ess-execute-in-process-buffer</CODE> which, if
<A NAME="IDX83"></A>
non-<CODE>nil</CODE>, means that these commands will produce their output in
the process buffer instead.  In any case, passing a prefix argument to
the commands (with <KBD>C-u</KBD>) will reverse the meaning of
<CODE>ess-execute-in-process-buffer</CODE> for that command, i.e. the output
will be displayed in the process buffer if it usually goes to a
temporary buffer, and vice-versa.  These are the hot keys that behave in
this way:



<UL>
<LI>

<KBD>C-c C-x</KBD> (<CODE>ess-execute-objects</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX84"></A>
Sends the <CODE>objects()</CODE>
<A NAME="IDX85"></A>
command to the <B>ESS</B> process.  A prefix argument specifies the
position on the search list (use a negative argument to toggle
<CODE>es-execute-in-process-buffer</CODE> as well).  A quick way to see what
objects are in your working directory.
<A NAME="IDX86"></A>
<A NAME="IDX87"></A>

<LI>

<KBD>C-c C-s</KBD> (<CODE>ess-execute-search</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX88"></A>
Sends the <CODE>search()</CODE>
<A NAME="IDX89"></A>
command to the ESS process.
<A NAME="IDX90"></A>
<A NAME="IDX91"></A>

<LI>

<KBD>C-c C-e</KBD> (<CODE>ess-execute</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX92"></A>
Prompt for an ESS expression, and evaluate it.
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>ess-execute</CODE> may seem pointless when you could just type the
command in anyway, but it proves useful for `spot' calculations which
would otherwise clutter your transcript, or for evaluating an expression
while partway through entering a command.  You can also use this command
to generate new hot keys using the Emacs keyboard macro facilities;
see section `Keyboard Macros' in <CITE>The GNU Emacs Reference Manual</CITE>.
<A NAME="IDX93"></A>
<A NAME="IDX94"></A>


<P>
The following hot keys do not use <CODE>ess-execute-in-process-buffer</CODE>
to decide where to display the output -- they either always display in
the process buffer or in a separate buffer, as indicated:



<UL>
<LI>

<KBD>C-c C-a</KBD> (<CODE>ess-execute-attach</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX95"></A>
Prompts for a directory to attach to the ESS process with the
<CODE>attach()</CODE> command.
<A NAME="IDX96"></A>
If a numeric prefix argument is given it is used as the position on the
search list to attach the directory; otherwise the <B>S</B> default of 2 is
used.  The <CODE>attach()</CODE> command actually executed appears in the
process buffer.

<LI>

<KBD>C-c C-l</KBD> (<CODE>ess-load-file</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX97"></A>
Prompts for a file to load into the <B>ESS</B> process using
<CODE>source()</CODE>.  If there is an error during loading, you can jump to
the error in the file with <KBD>C-x `</KBD> (<CODE>ess-parse-errors</CODE>).
<A NAME="IDX98"></A>
See section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC29">Detecting errors in source files</A>, for more details.

<LI>

<KBD>C-c C-v</KBD> (<CODE>ess-display-help-on-object</CODE>) <BR> Pops up a help
buffer for an <B>S</B> object or function.  See section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC35">Reading help files in ESS</A> for more
details.

<LI>

<KBD>C-c C-q</KBD> (<CODE>ess-quit</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX99"></A>
<A NAME="IDX100"></A>
Sends the <CODE>q()</CODE>
<A NAME="IDX101"></A>
command to the <B>ESS</B> process (or <CODE>(exit)</CODE>
<A NAME="IDX102"></A>
to the <B>XLS</B> process), and cleans up any temporary buffers (such as
help buffers or edit buffers) you may have created along the way.  Use
this command when you have finished your <B>S</B> session instead of simply
typing <CODE>q()</CODE> yourself, otherwise you will need to issue the command
<KBD>M-x ess-cleanup</KBD>
<A NAME="IDX103"></A>
<A NAME="IDX104"></A>
<A NAME="IDX105"></A>
<A NAME="IDX106"></A>

</UL>

<P>
Additional values may be recommended in the future as new interaction
protocols are created.  Unlike the values <CODE>iESS</CODE> and <CODE>ddeESS</CODE>,
ESS can't set these other values since the S language program is not
under the control of ESS.




<H2><A NAME="SEC25" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC25">Other commands provided by inferior-ESS</A></H2>

<P>
The following commands are also provided in the process buffer:



<UL>
<LI>

<KBD>C-c C-c</KBD> (<CODE>comint-interrupt-subjob</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX109"></A>
Sends a Control-C signal to the <B>ESS</B> process.  This has the effect of
<A NAME="IDX110"></A>
<A NAME="IDX111"></A>
aborting the current command.

<LI>

<KBD>C-c C-z</KBD> (<CODE>ess-abort</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX112"></A>
<A NAME="IDX113"></A>
Sends a STOP signal to the <B>ESS</B> process, killing it immediately.
It's not a good idea to use this, in general: Neither <CODE>q()</CODE> nor
<CODE>.Last</CODE> will be executed and device drivers will not finish
cleanly.  This command is provided as a safety to
<CODE>comint-stop-subjob</CODE>, which is usually bound to <KBD>C-c C-z</KBD>.  If

</UL>

<P>
Other commands available is Inferior <B>S</B> mode are discussed in

<H1><A NAME="SEC26" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC26">Editing <B>S</B> functions</A></H1>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX117"></A>
ESS provides facilities for editing <B>S</B> objects within your Emacs
session.  Most editing is performed on <B>S</B> functions, although in
theory you may edit datasets as well.  Edit buffers are always
associated with files, although you may choose to make these files
temporary if you wish.  Alternatively, you may make use of a simple yet
powerful mechanism for maintaining backups of text representations of
<B>S</B> functions.  Error-checking is performed when <B>S</B> code is loaded
into the <B>ESS</B> process.




<H2><A NAME="SEC27" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC27">Creating or modifying <B>S</B> objects</A></H2>

<UL>
<LI>

<KBD>C-c C-d</KBD> (<CODE>ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX119"></A>
Edit an <B>S</B> object in its own edit buffer.
</UL>

<P>
from within the <B>ESS</B> process buffer (<CODE>*S*</CODE>).  You will then be
prompted for an object to edit: you may either type in the name of an
existing object (for which completion is available using the <KBD>TAB</KBD>
key),
<A NAME="IDX120"></A>
or you may enter the name of a new object.
<A NAME="IDX121"></A>
<A NAME="IDX122"></A>
A buffer will be created containing the text representation of the
requested object or, if you entered the name of a non-existent object at
the prompt and the variable <CODE>ess-insert-function-templates</CODE>
<A NAME="IDX123"></A>
is non-<CODE>nil</CODE>, you will be presented with a template defined by
<CODE>ess-function-template</CODE>
<A NAME="IDX124"></A>
which defaults to a skeleton function construct.


<P>
You may then edit the function as required.  The edit buffer generated
by <CODE>ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer</CODE> is placed in the <CODE>ESS</CODE>
major mode which provides a number of commands to facilitate editing
<B>S</B> source code.  Commands are provided to intelligently indent <B>S</B>
code, evaluate portions of <B>S</B> code and to move around <B>S</B> code
constructs.


<P>
<A NAME="IDX125"></A>
<A NAME="IDX126"></A>
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> when you dump a file with <KBD>C-c C-d</KBD>, ESS first checks
to see whether there already exists an edit buffer containing that
object and, if so, pops you directly to that buffer.  If not, ESS next
checks whether there is a file in the appropriate place with the
appropriate name (see section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC33">Maintaining <B>S</B> source files</A>) and if so, reads in that file.
You can use this facility to return to an object you were editing in a
previous session (and which possibly was never loaded to the <B>S</B>
session).  Finally, if both these tests fail, the <B>ESS</B> process is
consulted and a <CODE>dump()</CODE> command issued.
<A NAME="IDX127"></A>
If you want to force ESS to ask the <B>ESS</B> process for the object's
definition (say, to reformat an unmodified buffer or to revert back to
S's idea of the object's definition) pass a prefix argument to
<CODE>ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer</CODE> by typing <KBD>C-u C-c C-d</KBD>.




<H2><A NAME="SEC28" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC28">Loading source files into the <B>ESS</B> process</A></H2>

<P>
The best way to get information -- particularly function definitions
--- into <B>S</B> is to load them in as source file, using S's
<CODE>source</CODE> function.  You have already seen how to create source
files using <KBD>C-c C-d</KBD>; ESS provides a complementary command for
loading source files (even files not created with ESS!) into the <B>ESS</B>
process:



<UL>
<LI>

<KBD>C-c C-l</KBD> (<CODE>ess-load-file</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX128"></A>
Loads a file into the <B>ESS</B> process using <CODE>source()</CODE>.
<A NAME="IDX129"></A>
</UL>

<P>
After typing <KBD>C-c C-l</KBD> you will prompted for the name of the file to
load into S; usually this is the current buffer's file which is the
default value (selected by simply pressing <KBD>RET</KBD> at the prompt).
You will be asked to save the buffer first if it has been modified (this
happens automatically if the buffer was generated with <KBD>C-c C-d</KBD>).
The file will then be loaded, and if it loads successfully you will be
returned to the <B>ESS</B> process.




<H2><A NAME="SEC29" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC29">Detecting errors in source files</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX130"></A>
<A NAME="IDX131"></A>
If any errors occur when loading a file with <CODE>C-c C-l</CODE>, ESS will
inform you of this fact.  In this case, you can jump directly to the
line in the source file which caused the error by typing <KBD>C-x `</KBD>
(<CODE>ess-parse-errors</CODE>).
<A NAME="IDX132"></A>
You will be returned to the offending file (loading it into a buffer if
necessary) with point at the line <B>S</B> reported as containing the
error.  You may then correct the error, and reload the file.  Note that
none of the commands in an <B>S</B> source file will take effect if any
part of the file contains errors.


<P>
Sometimes the error is not caused by a syntax error (loading a
non-existent file for example). In this case typing <KBD>C-x `</KBD> will
simply display a buffer containing S's error message.  You can force
this behavior (and avoid jumping to the file when there <EM>is</EM> a
syntax error) by passing a prefix argument to <CODE>ess-parse-errors</CODE>
with <KBD>C-u C-x `</KBD>.




<H2><A NAME="SEC30" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC30">Sending code to the <B>ESS</B> process</A></H2>

<P>
Other commands are also available for evaluating portions of code in the
S process.  These commands cause the selected code to be evaluated
directly by the <B>ESS</B> process as if you had typed them in at the
command line; the <CODE>source()</CODE> function is not used.  You may choose
whether both the commands and their output appear in the process buffer

<CODE>ess-eval-visibly-p</CODE> whose default is <CODE>nil</CODE>
<A NAME="IDX133"></A>
(display output only).  Passing a prefix argument (<KBD>C-u</KBD>) to any of
the following commands, however, reverses the meaning of
<CODE>ess-eval-visibly-p</CODE> for that command only -- for example <KBD>C-u
C-c C-j</KBD> echoes the current line of S (or other) code in the <B>ESS</B>

<LI>

<KBD>C-c C-r</KBD> (<CODE>ess-eval-region</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX142"></A>

<LI>

<KBD>C-c C-b</KBD> (<CODE>ess-eval-buffer</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX144"></A>
Send the contents of the edit buffer to the <B>ESS</B> process.

<LI>

<KBD>C-c M-b</KBD> (<CODE>ess-eval-buffer-and-go</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX145"></A>

<LI>

<KBD>C-c C-n</KBD> (<CODE>ess-eval-line-and-next-line</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX146"></A>
<A NAME="IDX147"></A>
<A NAME="IDX148"></A>
Sends the current line to the <B>ESS</B> process, echoing it in the process
buffer, and moves point to the next line.  Useful when debugging for
stepping through your code.
</UL>

<P>
It should be stressed once again that these <CODE>ess-eval-</CODE> commands
should only be used for evaluating small portions of code for debugging
purposes, or for generating transcripts from source files.  When editing
S functions, <KBD>C-c C-l</KBD> is the command to use to update the
function's value.  In particular, <CODE>ess-eval-buffer</CODE> is now largely
obsolete.


<P>
One final command is provided for spot-evaluations of <B>S</B> code:



<UL>
<KBD>C-c C-e</KBD> (<CODE>ess-execute-in-tb</CODE>) <BR>
Prompt for an <B>S</B> expression and evaluate it.  Displays result in a
temporary buffer.
</UL>

<P>
This is useful for quick calculations, etc.


<P>
All the above commands are useful for evaluating small amounts of code
and observing the results in the process buffer.  A useful way to work
is to divide the frame into two windows; one containing the source code
and the other containing the process buffer.  If you wish to make the
process buffer scroll automatically when the output reaches the bottom
of the window, you will need to set the variable
<CODE>comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-output</CODE> to <CODE>others</CODE> or <CODE>t</CODE>.

<H2><A NAME="SEC31" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC31">Indenting and formatting <B>S</B> code</A></H2>

<P>
ESS now provides a sophisticated mechanism for indenting <B>S</B> source
code (thanks to Ken'ichi Shibayama).  Compound statements (delimited by
<SAMP>`{'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`}'</SAMP>) are indented relative to their enclosing block.
In addition, the braces have been electrified to automatically indent to
the correct position when inserted, and optionally insert a newline at
the appropriate place as well.  Lines which continue an incomplete
expression are indented relative to the first line of the expression.
Function definitions, <CODE>if</CODE> statements, calls to <CODE>expression()</CODE>
and loop constructs are all recognized and indented appropriately.  User
variables are provided to control the amount if indentation in each
case, and there are also a number of predefined indentation styles to
choose from.  See section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC77">Variables controlling indentation</A>.


<P>
<A NAME="IDX150"></A>
Comments are also handled specially by ESS, using an idea borrowed from
the Emacs-Lisp indentation style.  By default,
comments beginning with <SAMP>`###'</SAMP>
are aligned to the beginning of the line.  Comments beginning with
<SAMP>`##'</SAMP> are aligned to the current level of indentation for the block
containing the comment.  Finally, comments beginning with <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> are
aligned to a column on the right (the 40th column by default, but this
value is controlled by the variable <CODE>comment-column</CODE>,)
<A NAME="IDX151"></A>
or just after the expression on the line containing the comment if it
extends beyond the indentation column.  You turn off the default
behavior by adding the line
<CODE>(setq ess-fancy-comments nil)</CODE> to your <TT>`.emacs'</TT> file.
<A NAME="IDX152"></A>
(GNU emacs uses the filename <TT>`~/.emacs'</TT> and
Xemacs uses the filename <TT>`~/.xemacs/init.el'</TT>
for the initialization file.)


<P>
The indentation commands provided by ESS are:
<A NAME="IDX153"></A>
<A NAME="IDX154"></A>



<UL>
<LI>

<A NAME="IDX149"></A>
 
<KBD>TAB</KBD> (<CODE>ess-indent-command</CODE>) <BR>
Indents the current line as <B>S</B> code.  If a prefix argument is given,
all following lines which are part of the same (compound) expression are
indented by the same amount (but relative indents are preserved).

<LI>

<KBD>LFD</KBD> (<CODE>newline-and-indent</CODE>) <BR>
Insert a newline, and indent the next line.  (Note: if your keyboard
does not have a <KBD>LINEFEED</KBD> key, you can use <KBD>C-j</KBD> instead.)
Some people prefer to bind <KBD>RET</KBD> to this command.

<LI>

<KBD>ESC C-q</KBD> (<CODE>ess-indent-exp</CODE>) <BR>
Indents each line in the <B>S</B> (compound) expression which follows point.
Very useful for beautifying your <B>S</B> code.

<LI>

<KBD>{</KBD> and <KBD>}</KBD> (<CODE>ess-electric-brace</CODE>) <BR>
The braces automatically indent to the correct position when typed.

<LI>

<KBD>M-;</KBD> (<CODE>indent-for-comment</CODE>) <BR>
Indents a comment line appropriately, or inserts an empty
(single-<SAMP>`#'</SAMP>) comment.

<LI>

<KBD>M-x ess-set-style</KBD> <BR>
Set the formatting style in this buffer to be one of the predefined
styles: <CODE>GNU</CODE>, <CODE>BSD</CODE>, <CODE>K&#38;R</CODE>, <CODE>CLB</CODE>, and <CODE>C++</CODE>.
The <CODE>DEFAULT</CODE> style uses the default values for the indenting
variables (unless they have been modified in your <TT>`.emacs'</TT> file.)
<A NAME="IDX155"></A>
This command causes all of the formatting variables
see section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC77">Variables controlling indentation</A> to be buffer-local.
</UL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC32" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC32">Commands for motion, completion and more</A></H2>

<P>
A number of commands are provided to move across function definitions
in the edit buffer:

<UL>
<LI>

<KBD>ESC C-e</KBD> (<CODE>ess-beginning-of-function</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX156"></A>
Moves point to the beginning of the function containing point.

<LI>

<KBD>ESC C-a</KBD> (<CODE>ess-end-of-function</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX157"></A>
Moves point to the end of the function containing point.

<LI>

<KBD>ESC C-h</KBD> (<CODE>ess-mark-function</CODE>) <BR>
Places point at the beginning of the <B>S</B> function containing point, and
mark at the end.
</UL>

<P>
Don't forget the usual Emacs commands for moving over balanced
expressions and parentheses: See section `Lists and Sexps' in <CITE>The GNU Emacs Reference Manual</CITE>.


<P>
<A NAME="IDX158"></A>
Completion is provided in the edit buffer in a similar fashion to the
process buffer: <KBD>M-TAB</KBD> completes file names and <KBD>M-?</KBD> lists
file completions.  Since <KBD>TAB</KBD> is used for indentation in the edit
buffer, object completion is now performed with <KBD>C-c TAB</KBD>.  Note
however that completion is only provided over globally known S objects
(such as system functions) -- it will <EM>not</EM> work for arguments to
functions or other variables local to the function you are editing.


<P>
Finally, two commands are provided for returning to the <B>ESS</B> process buffer:



<UL>
<LI>

<KBD>C-c C-z</KBD> (<CODE>ess-switch-to-end-of-ESS</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX159"></A>
Returns you to the <B>ESS</B> process buffer, placing point at the end of the
buffer.

<LI>

<KBD>C-c C-y</KBD> (<CODE>ess-switch-to-ESS</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX160"></A>
Also returns to to the <B>ESS</B> process buffer, but leaves point where it is.
</UL>

<P>
In addition some commands available in the process buffer are also
available in the edit buffer.  You can still read help files with
<KBD>C-c C-v</KBD>, edit another function with <KBD>C-c C-d</KBD> and of course
<KBD>C-c C-l</KBD> can be used to load a source file into S.  See section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC25">Other commands provided by inferior-ESS</A>,
for more details on these commands.




<H2><A NAME="SEC33" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC33">Maintaining <B>S</B> source files</A></H2>

<P>
Every edit buffer in ESS is associated with a <EM>dump file</EM> on disk.
Dump files are created whenever you type <KBD>C-c C-d</KBD>
(<CODE>ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer</CODE>), and may either be deleted
after use, or kept as a backup file or as a means of keeping several
versions of an <B>S</B> function.
<A NAME="IDX161"></A>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>User Option:</U> <B>ess-delete-dump-files</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX162"></A>
If non-<CODE>nil</CODE>, dump files created with C-c C-d are deleted
immediately after they are created by the ess-process.
</DL>


<P>
Since immediately after <B>S</B> dumps an object's definition to a disk
file the source code on disk corresponds exactly to S's idea of the
object's definition, the disk file isn't really needed; deleting it now
has the advantage that if you <EM>don't</EM> modify the file (say, because
you just wanted to look at the definition of one of the standard S
functions) the source dump file won't be left around when you kill the
buffer.  Note that this variable only applies to files generated with
S's <CODE>dump</CODE> function; it doesn't apply to source files which already
exist.  The default value is <CODE>t</CODE>.


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>User Option:</U> <B>ess-keep-dump-files</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX163"></A>
Option controlling what to do with the dump file after an object has
been successfully loaded into S.  Valid values are <CODE>nil</CODE> (always
delete), <CODE>ask</CODE> (always ask whether to delete), <CODE>check</CODE> (delete
files generated with <KBD>C-c C-d</KBD> in this Emacs session, otherwise ask
--- this is the default) and <CODE>t</CODE> (never delete).  This variable is
buffer-local.
</DL>


<P>
After an object has been successfully (i.e. without error) been loaded
back into <B>S</B> with <KBD>C-c C-l</KBD>, the disk file again corresponds
exactly (well, almost -- see below) to S's record of the object's
definition, and so some people prefer to delete the disk file rather
than unnecessarily use up space.  This option allows you to do just
that.


<P>
<A NAME="IDX164"></A>
<A NAME="IDX165"></A>
<A NAME="IDX166"></A>
If the value of <CODE>ess-keep-dump-files</CODE> is <CODE>t</CODE>, dump files are
never deleted after they are loaded.  Thus you can maintain a complete
text record of the functions you have edited within ESS.  Backup files
kept as usual, and so by using the Emacs numbered backup facility ---
see section `Single or Numbered Backups' in <CITE>The Gnu Emacs Reference Manual</CITE>, you can keep a historic
record of function definitions.  Another possibility is to maintain the
files with a version-control system such as RCS See section `Version Control' in <CITE>The Gnu Emacs Reference Manual</CITE>.  As long as a dump file exists in the appropriate place for a
particular object, editing that object with <KBD>C-c C-d</KBD> finds that
file for editing (unless a prefix argument is given) -- the <B>ESS</B>
process is not consulted.  Thus you can keep comments <EM>outside</EM> the
function definition as a means of documentation that does not clutter
the <B>S</B> object itself.  Another useful feature is that you may format
the code in any fashion you please without <B>S</B> re-indenting the code
every time you edit it.  These features are particularly useful for
project-based work.


<P>
If the value of <CODE>ess-keep-dump-files</CODE> is nil, the dump file is always
silently deleted after a successful load with <KBD>C-c C-l</KBD>.  While this
is useful for files that were created with <KBD>C-c C-d</KBD> it also applies
to any other file you load (say, a source file of function
definitions), and so can be dangerous to use unless you are careful.
Note that since <CODE>ess-keep-dump-files</CODE> is buffer-local, you can make
sure particular files are not deleted by setting it to <CODE>t</CODE> in the
Local Variables section of the file See section `Local Variables in Files' in <CITE>The Gnu Emacs Reference Manual</CITE>.


<P>
A safer option is to set <CODE>ess-keep-dump-files</CODE> to <CODE>ask</CODE>; this
means that ESS will always ask for confirmation before deleting the
file.  Since this can get annoying if you always want to delete dump
files created with <CODE>C-c C-d</CODE>, but not any other files, setting
<CODE>ess-keep-dump-files</CODE> to <CODE>check</CODE> (the default value) will
silently delete dump files created with <KBD>C-c C-d</KBD> in the current
Emacs session, but query for any other file.  Note that in any case you
will only be asked for confirmation once per file, and your answer is
remembered for the rest of the Emacs session.


<P>
Note that in all cases, if an error (such as a syntax error) is detected
while loading the file with <KBD>C-c C-l</KBD>, the dump file is <EM>never</EM>
deleted.  This is so that you can edit the file in a new Emacs session
if you happen to quit Emacs before correcting the error.


<P>
<A NAME="IDX167"></A>
Dump buffers are always autosaved, regardless of the value of
<CODE>ess-keep-dump-files</CODE>.




<H2><A NAME="SEC34" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC34">Names and locations of dump files</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX168"></A>
Every dump file should be given a unique file name, usually the dumped
object name with some additions.


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>User Option:</U> <B>ess-dump-filename-template</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX169"></A>
Template for filenames of dumped objects.  <CODE>%s</CODE> is replaced by the
object name.
</DL>


<P>
By default, dump file names are the user name, followed by <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> and
the object and ending with <SAMP>`.S'</SAMP>.  Thus if user <CODE>joe</CODE> dumps the
object <CODE>myfun</CODE> the dump file will have name <TT>`joe.myfun.S'</TT>.
The username part is included to avoid clashes when dumping into a
publicly-writable directory, such as <TT>`/tmp'</TT>; you may wish to remove
this part if you are dumping into a directory owned by you.


<P>
<A NAME="IDX170"></A>
You may also specify the directory in which dump files are written:


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>User Option:</U> <B>ess-source-directory</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX171"></A>
Directory name (ending in a slash) where <B>S</B> dump files are to be written.
</DL>


<P>
By default, dump files are always written to <TT>`/tmp'</TT>, which is fine
when <CODE>ess-keep-dump-files</CODE> is <CODE>nil</CODE>.  If you are keeping dump
files, then you will probably want to keep them somewhere in your home
directory, say <TT>`~/S-source'</TT>.  This could be achieved by including
the following line in your <TT>`.emacs'</TT> file:
<A NAME="IDX172"></A>

<PRE>
(setq ess-source-directory (expand-file-name "~/S-source/"))
</PRE>

<P>
If you would prefer to keep your dump files in separate directories
depending on the value of some variable, ESS provides a facility for
this also.  By setting <CODE>ess-source-directory</CODE> to a lambda
expression which evaluates to a directory name, you have a great deal of
flexibility in selecting the directory for a particular source file to
appear in.  The lambda expression is evaluated with the process buffer
as the current buffer and so you can use the variables local to that
buffer to make your choice.  For example, the following expression
causes source files to be saved in the subdirectory <TT>`Src'</TT> of the
directory the <B>ESS</B> process was run in.



<PRE>
(setq ess-source-directory
      (lambda ()
         (concat ess-directory "Src/")))
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX173"></A>
(<CODE>ess-directory</CODE> is a buffer-local variable in process buffers
which records the directory the <B>ESS</B> process was run from.)  This is
useful if you keep your dump files and you often edit objects with the
same name in different <B>ESS</B> processes.  Alternatively, if you often
change your <B>S</B> working directory during an <B>S</B> session, you may
like to keep dump files in some subdirectory of the directory pointed to
by the first element of the current search list.  This way you can edit
objects of the same name in different directories during the one S
session:
<A NAME="IDX174"></A>
<A NAME="IDX175"></A>

<PRE>
(setq ess-source-directory
   (lambda ()
       (file-name-as-directory
        (expand-file-name (concat
                           (car ess-search-list)
                           "/.Src")))))
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX176"></A>


<P>
If the directory generated by the lambda function does not exist but can
be created, you will be asked whether you wish to create the directory.
If you choose not to, or the directory cannot be created, you will not
be able to edit functions.




<H1><A NAME="SEC35" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC35">Reading help files in ESS</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX177"></A>


<P>
ESS provides an easy-to-use facility for reading <B>S</B> help files from
within Emacs.  From within the <B>ESS</B> process buffer or any ESS edit
buffer, typing <KBD>C-c C-v</KBD> (<CODE>ess-display-help-on-object</CODE>)
<A NAME="IDX178"></A>
will prompt you for the name of an object for which you would like
documentation.  Completion is provided over all objects which have help
files.


<P>
If the requested object has documentation, you will be popped into a
buffer (named <CODE>*help(<VAR>obj-name</VAR>)*</CODE>) containing the help file.
This buffer is placed in a special `S Help' mode which disables the
usual editing commands but which provides a number of keys for paging
through the help file:



<UL>
Help commands:

<LI>

<KBD>?</KBD> (<CODE>ess-describe-help-mode</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX179"></A>
Pops up a help buffer with a list of the commands available in <B>S</B> help
mode.

<LI>

<KBD>h</KBD> (<CODE>ess-display-help-on-object</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX180"></A>

Paging commands:

<A NAME="IDX181"></A>
<LI>

<KBD>b</KBD> or <KBD>DEL</KBD> (<CODE>scroll-down</CODE>) <BR>
Move one page backwards through the help file.

<LI>

<KBD>SPC</KBD> (<CODE>scroll-up</CODE>) <BR>
Move one page forwards through the help file.

<LI>

<KBD>&#62;</KBD> (<CODE>beginning-of-buffer</CODE>) and <KBD>&#60;</KBD> (<CODE>end-of-buffer</CODE>)
<BR>
Move to the beginning and end of the help file, respectively.

Section-based motion commands:

<LI>

<KBD>n</KBD> (<CODE>ess-skip-to-next-section</CODE>) and <KBD>p</KBD>
(<CODE>ess-skip-to-previous-section</CODE>) <BR> Move to the next and previous
<A NAME="IDX182"></A>
<A NAME="IDX183"></A>
section header in the help file, respectively.  A section header
consists of a number of capitalized words, followed by a colon.

In addition, the <KBD>s</KBD> key followed by one of the following letters

<LI>

<KBD>q</KBD> (<CODE>ess-switch-to-end-of-ESS</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX186"></A>

<LI>

<KBD>x</KBD> (<CODE>ess-kill-buffer-and-go</CODE>) <BR>
Return to the <B>ESS</B> process, killing this help buffer.
</UL>

<P>
In addition, all of the ESS commands available in the edit buffers are
also available in <B>S</B> help mode (see section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC27">Creating or modifying <B>S</B> objects</A>).  Of course, the
usual (non-editing) Emacs commands are available, and for convenience
the digits and <KBD>-</KBD> act as prefix arguments.


<P>
If a help buffer already exists for an object for which help is
requested, that buffer is popped to immediately; the <B>ESS</B> process is
not consulted at all.  If the contents of the help file have changed,
you either need to kill the help buffer first, or pass a prefix argument
(with <KBD>C-u</KBD>) to <CODE>ess-display-help-on-object</CODE>.


<P>
Help buffers are marked as temporary buffers in ESS, and are deleted
when <CODE>ess-quit</CODE> or <CODE>ess-cleanup</CODE> are called.

<H1><A NAME="SEC36" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC36">Manipulating saved transcript files</A></H1>

<P>
Inferior <B>S</B> mode records the transcript (the list of all commands
executed, and their output) in the process buffer, which can be saved as
a <EM>transcript file</EM>, which should normally have the suffix
<TT>`.St'</TT>.  The most obvious use for a transcript file is as a static
record of the actions you have performed in a particular <B>S</B> session.
Sometimes, however, you may wish to re-execute commands recorded in the
transcript file by submitting them to a running <B>ESS</B> process.  This
is what Transcript Mode is for.


<P>
If you load file a with the suffix <TT>`.St'</TT> into Emacs, it is placed
in S Transcript Mode.  Transcript Mode is similar to Inferior <B>S</B> mode
(see section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC12">Interacting with the <B>ESS</B> process</A>):
<A NAME="IDX190"></A>
<A NAME="IDX191"></A>
paragraphs are defined as a command and its output, and you can move
though commands either with the paragraph commands or with <KBD>C-c C-p</KBD>
and <KBD>C-c C-n</KBD>.




<H2><A NAME="SEC37" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC37">Resubmitting commands from the transcript file</A></H2>

<P>
Three commands are provided to re-submit command lines from the
transcript file to a running <B>ESS</B> process.  They are:



<UL>
<LI>

<KBD>RET</KBD> (<CODE>ess-transcript-send-command</CODE>) <BR>
Send the current command line to the <B>ESS</B> process, and execute it.
<A NAME="IDX192"></A>

<LI>

<KBD>C-c RET</KBD> (<CODE>ess-transcript-copy-command</CODE>) <BR>
Copy the current command to the <B>ESS</B> process, and switch to the
<B>ESS</B> process buffer (ready to edit the copied command).
<A NAME="IDX193"></A>

<LI>

<KBD>M-RET</KBD> (<CODE>ess-transcript-send-command-and-move</CODE>) <BR>
Send the current command to the <B>ESS</B> process, and move to the next
command line.  This command is useful for submitting a series of
commands.
</UL>

<P>
Note that these commands are similar to those on the same keys in
Inferior <B>S</B> Mode.  In all three cases, the commands should be
executed when the cursor is on a command line in the transcript; the
prompt is automatically removed before the command is submitted.




<H2><A NAME="SEC38" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC38">Cleaning transcript files</A></H2>

<P>
Yet another use for transcript files is to extract the command lines for
inclusion in an <B>S</B> source file or function.  Transcript mode provides
one command which does just this:



<UL>
<LI>

<KBD>C-c C-w</KBD> (<CODE>ess-transcript-clean-region</CODE>) <BR>
Deletes all prompts and command output in the region, leaving only the
commands themselves.
</UL>

<P>
The remaining command lines may then be copied to a source file or edit
buffer for inclusion in a function definition, or may be evaluated
directly (see section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC30">Sending code to the <B>ESS</B> process</A>) using the code evaluation commands
from <B>S</B> mode, also available in <B>S</B> Transcript Mode.




<H1><A NAME="SEC39" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC39">Other features of ESS</A></H1>

<P>
ESS has a few miscellaneous features, which didn't fit anywhere else.




<H2><A NAME="SEC40" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC40">Syntactic highlighting of buffers</A></H2>

<P>
ESS provides Font-Lock (see section `Using Multiple Typefaces' in <CITE>The Gnu Emacs Reference Manual</CITE>) patterns for Inferior <B>S</B> Mode, S
Mode, and <B>S</B> Transcript Mode buffers.
<A NAME="IDX194"></A>
<A NAME="IDX195"></A>


<P>
To activate the highlighting, you need to turn on Font Lock mode in the
appropriate buffers.  This can be done on a per-buffer basis with
<KBD>M-x font-lock-mode</KBD>, or may be done by adding
<CODE>turn-on-font-lock</CODE> to <CODE>inferior-ess-mode-hook</CODE>,
<CODE>ess-mode-hook</CODE> and <CODE>ess-transcript-mode-hook</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC79">Customizing ESS with hooks</A>).  Your systems administrator may have done this for you
in <TT>`ess-site.el'</TT> (see section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC73">Customizing ESS</A>).


<P>
The font-lock patterns are defined in three variables, which you may
modify if desired:


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Variable:</U> <B>ess-inf-font-lock-keywords</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX196"></A>
Font-lock patterns for Inferior <B>ESS</B> Mode.  The default value
highlights prompts, inputs, assignments, output messages, vector and
matrix labels, and literals such as <SAMP>`NA'</SAMP> and <CODE>TRUE</CODE>.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Variable:</U> <B>ESS-font-lock-keywords</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX197"></A>
Font-lock patterns for <B>ESS</B> programming mode.  The default value
highlights function names, literals, assignments, source functions and
reserved words.
</DL>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Variable:</U> <B>ess-trans-font-lock-keywords</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX198"></A>
Font-lock patterns for <B>ESS</B> Transcript Mode.  The default value
highlights the same stuff as in Inferior <B>ESS</B> Mode.
</DL>




<H2><A NAME="SEC41" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC41">Using graphics with ESS</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX199"></A>
One of the main features of the <CODE>S</CODE> package is its ability to
generate high-resolution graphics plots, and ESS provides a number of
features for dealing with such plots.




<H3><A NAME="SEC42" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC42">Using ESS with the <CODE>printer()</CODE> driver</A></H3>

<P>
This is the simplest (and least desirable) method of using graphics
within ESS.  S's <CODE>printer()</CODE> device driver produces crude character
based plots which can be contained within the <B>ESS</B> process buffer
itself.  To start using character graphics, issue the <B>S</B> command

<PRE>
printer(width=79)
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX200"></A>
(the <CODE>width=79</CODE> argument prevents Emacs line-wrapping at column
80 on an 80-column terminal.  Use a different value for a terminal with
a different number of columns.) Plotting commands do not generate
graphics immediately, but are stored until the <CODE>show()</CODE> command
is issued, which displays the current figure.




<H3><A NAME="SEC43" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC43">Using ESS with windowing devices</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX201"></A>
Of course, the ideal way to use graphics with ESS is to use a windowing
system.  Under X windows, this requires that the DISPLAY environment
variable be appropriately set, which may not always be the case within
your Emacs process.  ESS provides a facility for setting the value of
DISPLAY before the <B>ESS</B> process is started if the variable
<CODE>ess-ask-about-display</CODE>
<A NAME="IDX202"></A>
is non-<CODE>nil</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC73">Customizing ESS</A>, for details of this variable,
and see section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC7">Starting the <B>ESS</B> process</A> for information on how to set the value of
DISPLAY when beginning an <B>S</B> session.




<H2><A NAME="SEC44" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC44">Object Completion</A></H2>

<P>
If you are running S-PLUS or R, you might consider installing the
database files.  From within (X)Emacs, "C-x d" to the directory
containing ESS.  Now:


<P>
<CODE>M-x S+3</CODE>


<P>
(get S-PLUS running.  once you have reached the SPLUS 3.x prompt, do:)


<P>
<CODE>M-x ess-create-object-name-db</CODE>


<P>
(this will create the file: ess-s+3-namedb.el; if it isn't in the ESS
directory, move it there).


<P>
Then, completions will be autoloaded and will not be regenerated for
every session.


<P>
For R:


<P>
<CODE>M-x R</CODE>


<P>
(get R running.  once you have reached the R prompt, do:)


<P>
<CODE>M-x ess-create-object-name-db</CODE>


<P>
(this will create the file: ess-r-namedb.el; if it isn't in the ESS
directory, move it there).

<P>
<A NAME="IDX203"></A>

<UL>
<LI>

Commands like <CODE>ess-display-help-on-object</CODE> and list completion
cannot be used while the user is entering a multi-line command.  The
only real fix in this situation is to use another <B>ESS</B> process.

<LI>

The <CODE>ess-eval-</CODE> commands can leave point in the <B>ESS</B> process
buffer in the wrong place when point is at the same position as the last
process output.  This proves difficult to fix, in general, as we need to
consider all <EM>windows</EM> with <CODE>window-point</CODE> at the right place.

<LI>

It's possible to clear the modification flag (say, by saving the buffer)
with the edit buffer not having been loaded into S.

<LI>

Backup files can sometimes be left behind, even when
<CODE>ess-keep-dump-files</CODE> is <CODE>nil</CODE>.

<LI>

Passing an incomplete <B>S</B> expression to <CODE>ess-execute</CODE> causes ESS
to hang.

<LI>

The function-based commands don't always work as expected on functions
whose body is not a parenthesized or compound expression, and don't even
recognize anonymous functions (i.e. functions not assigned to any
variable).

<LI>

Multi-line commands could be handled better by the command history
mechanism.

<H2><A NAME="SEC50" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC50">ESS[S]--Editing files</A></H2>

<P>
ESS[S] is the mode for editing S language files.  This mode handles:



<UL>
<LI>

 proper indenting, generated by both [Tab] and [Return].
<LI>

 color and font choices based on syntax.
<LI>

 ability to send the contents of an entire buffer, a highlighted
  region, an S function, or a single line to an inferior S process, if
  one is currently running.
<LI>

 ability to switch between processes which would be the target of the
  buffer (for the above).
<LI>

 The ability to request help from an S process for variables and
  functions, and to have the results sent into a separate buffer.
<LI>

 completion of object names and file names.
</UL>

<P>
ESS[S] mode should be automatically turned on when loading a file with
the suffices found in ess-site (*.R, *.S, *.s, etc).  However, one
will have to start up an inferior process to take advantage of the
interactive features.




<H2><A NAME="SEC51" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC51">iESS[S]--Inferior ESS processes</A></H2>
<P>
iESS (inferior ESS) is the mode for interfacing with active
statistical processes (programs).  This mode handles:



<UL>
<LI>

 proper indenting, generated by both [Tab] and [Return].
<LI>

 color and font highlighting based on syntax.
<LI>

 ability to resubmit the contents of a multi-line command
 to the executing process with a single keystroke [RET].
<LI>

 The ability to request help from the current process for variables
 and functions, and to have the results sent into a separate buffer.
<LI>

 completion of object names and file names.
<LI>

 interactive history mechanism
<LI>

</UL>

<P>
To start up iESS mode, use:

<PRE>
   M-x S+3
   M-x S4
   M-x R
</PRE>

<P>
(for S-PLUS 3.x, S4, and R, respectively.  This assumes that you have
access to each).  Usually the site will have defined one of these programs
(by default S+3) to the simpler name:


<P>
   M-x S


<P>
Note that R has some extremely useful command line arguments,
-v and -n.   To enter these, call R using a "prefix argument", by


<P>
   C-u M-x R


<P>
and when ESS prompts for "Starting Args ? ", enter (for example):


<P>
   -v 10000 -n 5000


<P>
Then that R process will be started up using "R -v 10000 -n 5000".


<P>
New for ESS 5.1.2 (and later):  "S-elsewhere" command


<P>
  The idea of "M-x S-elsewhere" is that we open a telnet (or rlogin)
  to another machine, call the buffer "*S-elsewhere*", and then run S
  on the other machine in that buffer.  We do that by defining "sh" as
  the inferior-S-elsewhere-program-name.  Emacs sets it up in a
  "*S-elsewhere*" iESS buffer.  The user does a telnet or login from
  that buffer to the other machine and then starts S on the other
  machine.  The usual C-c C-n commands from myfile.s on the local
  machine get sent through the buffer "*S-elsewhere*" to be executed
  by S on the other machine.

<P>
The first is preferred, and configured for.  The second one can be
retrieved again, by changing emacs variables.


<P>
1: (preferred by the current group of developers):  The source code is
   real.  The objects are realizations of the source code.  Source
   for EVERY user modified object is placed in a particular directory
   or directories, for later editing and retrieval.


<P>
2: (older version): S objects are real.  Source code is a temporary
   realization of the objects.  Dumped buffers should not be saved.
   _We_strongly_discourage_this_approach_.  However, if you insist,
   add the following lines to your .emacs file
(GNU emacs uses the filename <TT>`~/.emacs'</TT> and
Xemacs uses the filename <TT>`~/.xemacs/init.el'</TT>
for the initialization file):

<PRE>
(setq ess-keep-dump-files 'nil)
(setq ess-delete-dump-files t)
(setq ess-mode-silently-save nil)
</PRE>

<P>
The second saves a small amount of disk space.  The first allows for
better portability as well as external version control for code.




<H2><A NAME="SEC55" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC55">Scenarios for use (possibilities--based on actual usage)</A></H2>

<P>
We present some basic suggestions for using ESS to interact with S.
These are just a subset of approaches, many better approaches are
possible.  Contributions of examples of how you work with ESS are
appreciated (especially since it helps us determine priorities on
future enhancements)! (comments as to what should be happening are
prefixed by "##").

<PRE>
1:  ##    Data Analysis Example (source code is real)
    ## Load the file you want to work with
    C-x C-f myfile.s

    ## Edit as appropriate, and then start up S-PLUS 3.x
    M-x S+3

    ## A new buffer *S+3:1* will appear.  Splus will have been started
    ## in this buffer.  The buffer is in iESS [S+3:1] mode.

    ## Split the screen and go back to the file editing buffer.
    C-x 2 C-x b myfile.s

    ## Send regions, lines, or the entire file contents to S-PLUS.  For regions,
    ## highlight a region with keystrokes or mouse and then send with:
    C-c C-r

    ## Re-edit myfile.s as necessary to correct any difficulties.  Add
    ## new commands here.  Send them to S by region with C-c C-r, or
    ## one line at a time with C-c C-n.

    ## Save the revised myfile.s with C-x C-s.

    ## Save the entire *S+3:1* interaction buffer with C-c C-s.  You
    ## will be prompted for a file name.  The recommended name is
    ## myfile.St.  With the *.St suffix, the file will come up in ESS
    ## Transcript mode the next time it is accessed from Emacs.

2:  ## Program revision example (source code is real)

    ## Start up S-PLUS 3.x in a process buffer (this will be *S+3:1*)
    M-x S+3

    ## Load the file you want to work with
    C-x C-f myfile.s

    ## edit program, functions, and code in myfile.s, and send revised
    ## functions to S when ready with
    C-c C-f
    ## or highlighted regions with
    C-c C-r
    ## or individual lines with
    C-c C-n
    ## or load the entire buffer with
    C-c C-l

    ## save the revised myfile.s when you have finished
    C-c C-s

3:  ## Program revision example (S object is real)

    ## Start up S-PLUS 3.x in a process buffer (this will be *S+3:1*)
    M-x S+3

    ## Dump an existing S object my.function into a buffer to work with
    C-c C-d my.function
    ## a new buffer named yourloginname.my.function.S will be created with
    ## an editable copy of the object.  The buffer is associated with the
    ## pathname /tmp/yourloginname.my.function.S and will amlost certainly not
    ## exist after you log off.

    ## enter program, functions, and code into work buffer, and send
    ## entire contents to S-PLUS when ready
    C-c C-b

    ## Go to *S+3:1* buffer, which is the process buffer, and examine
    ## the results.
    C-c C-y
    ## The sequence C-c C-y is a shortcut for:  C-x b *S+3:1*

    ## Return to the work buffer (may/may not be prefixed)
    C-x C-b yourloginname.my.function.S
    ## Fix the function that didn't work, and resubmit by placing the
    ## cursor somewhere in the function and
    C-c C-f
    ## Or you could've selected a region (using the mouse, or keyboard
    ## via setting point/mark) and
    C-c C-r
    ## Or you could step through, line by line, using
    C-c C-n
    ## Or just send a single line (without moving to the next) using
    C-c C-j
    ## To fix that error in syntax for the "rchisq" command, get help
    ## by
    C-c C-v rchisq

4:    Data Analysis (S object is real)
    ## Start up S-PLUS 3.x, in a process buffer (this will be *S+3:1*)
    M-x S+3

    ## Work in the process buffer.  When you find an object that needs
    ## to be changed (this could be a data frame, or a variable, or a
    ## function), dump it to a buffer:
    C-c C-d my.cool.function

    ## Edit the function as appropriate, and dump back in to the
    ## process buffer
    C-c C-b

    ## Return to the S-PLUS process buffer
    C-c C-y
    ## Continue working.

    ## When you need help, use
    C-c C-v rchisq
    ## instead of entering:   help("rchisq")
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC56" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC56">Customization Examples and Solutions to Problems</A></H2>

<P>
1. Suppose that you are primarily an SPLUS 3.4 user, occasionally
   using S version 4, and sick and tired of the buffer-name *S+3*
   we've stuck you with.  Simply edit the "ess-dialect" alist entry in
   the essd-s+3.el and essd-s4.el files to be "S" instead of "S4" and
   "S+3".  This will insure that all the inferior process buffer names
   are "*S*".


<P>
2. Suppose that you WANT to have the first buffer name indexed by
   ":1", in the same manner as your S-PLUS processes 2,3,4, and 5 (for
   you heavy simulation people).  Then uncomment the line in ess-site
   (or add after your (require 'ess-site) or (load "ess-site") command
    in your .emacs file, the line:

<PRE>
(setq ess-plain-first-buffername nil)
</PRE>

<P>
   )


<P>
3. Fontlocking sometimes fails to behave nicely upon errors.  When
   Splus dumps, a mis-matched "  (double-quote) can result in the
   wrong font-lock face being used for the remainder of the buffer.


<P>
   Solution: add a " at the end of the "Dumped..." statement, to
   revert the font-lock face back to normal.




<H1><A NAME="SEC57" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC57">Help for SAS</A></H1>

<P>
ESS[SAS] was designed for use with SAS.  It is descended from  
SAS-mode which was originally developed by Cook.  Those
editing features and new advanced features are part of ESS[SAS].  
The user interface of ESS[SAS] has similarities with ESS[S], the ESS
interface for S, and to the SAS Display Manager.  By emacs, we mean 
either GNU Emacs from the Free Software Foundation or XEmacs from the 
XEmacs Project.




<H2><A NAME="SEC58" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC58">ESS[SAS]--Design philosophy</A></H2>

<P>
ESS[SAS] mode was designed to aid the user in writing and maintaining
input command files, such as myfile.sas, for SAS.  These are files
containing SAS statements.  In a batch environment such files would be
submitted to SAS by the operating system command:

<PRE>
sas myfile.sas
</PRE>

<P>
In a SAS window environment, these files would be brought into the
"SAS: PROGRAM EDITOR" window and then submitted with the 'Local' 'Submit'
menu commands.


<P>
The *SAS:1.log* buffer in ESStr mode corresponds to the file
myfile.log in SAS batch usage and to the "SAS: LOG" window in the SAS
window environment.  All commands submitted to SAS, informative
messages, warnings, and errors appear here.


<P>
The *SAS:1.lst* buffer in ESSlst mode corresponds to the file
myfile.lst in SAS batch usage and to the "SAS: OUTPUT" window in the
SAS window environment.  All data related printed output from the
PROCs appear in this window.


<P>
The iESS [SAS:1] buffer exists solely as a communications buffer.
Files are edited in the myfile.sas buffer.  The C-c C-r key in
ESS[SAS] mode is the functional equivalent of bringing a file into the
"SAS: PROGRAM EDITOR" window followed by the 'Local' 'Submit' menu
commands.  The user should never use this buffer directly.


<P>
The ESS[SAS] mode was written with two primary goals.


<P>
1. Using the emacs environment is desirable for users accessing a remote
computer
via a network or dial-up who can not use the native SAS window environment.


<P>
2. Using the emacs environment is desirable for local users as well due to the
inherent efficiency of using the same superior interface all of the time.




<H2><A NAME="SEC59" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC59">ESS[SAS]--Recommended autoexec.sas</A></H2>

<P>
The default settings of the inferior-SAS-args in essd-sas.el are



<PRE>
-stdio -linesize 80 -noovp -nosyntaxcheck
</PRE>

<P>
with the interpretations:

<PRE>
-stdio          required to make the redirection of stdio work
-linesize 80    keeps output lines from folding on standard terminals
-noovp          prevents error messages from printing 3 times
-nosyntaxcheck  permits recovery after syntax errors
</PRE>

<P>
In addition there are several parameters that can't be set in the
command line.  For these, we recommend the following line appear in
your autoexec.sas in your home directory:



<PRE>
options noovp pagesize=60 linesize=80 formdlim=' ';
</PRE>

<P>
Interpretations

<PRE>
noovp          prevents error messages from printing 3 time
pagesize=60    standard printed page length instead of window length
linesize=80    keeps output lines from folding on standard terminals
formdlim=' '   blank replaces "C-l" formfeeds to prevent mostly
               empty pages
</PRE>

<P>
The noovp and linesize=80 appear in both the inferior-SAS-args and in
the autoexec.sas.  The redundancy means that these options are in
effect for both SAS interactive and batch jobs.




<H2><A NAME="SEC60" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC60">ESS[SAS]--Editing files</A></H2>

<P>
ESS[SAS] is the mode for editing SAS language files.  This mode handles:



<PRE>
- proper indenting, generated by both [Tab] and [Return].
- color and font choices based on syntax.
- ability to send the contents of an entire buffer, a highlighted region,
  or a single line to an inferior SAS process.
- ability to switch between processes which would be the target of the
  buffer (for the above).
- ability to save and submit the file you are working on as a batch SAS
  process with a single keypress and to continue editing while it is runs
  in the background.
- capability of killing the batch SAS process through the shell buffer or
  allow the SAS process to keep on running after you exit emacs.
- single keypress navigation of .sas, .log and .lst files (.log and .lst
  files are automatically refreshed with each keypress).
</PRE>

<P>
ESS[SAS], the mode for editing SAS language files, is automatically
turned on when editing a file with a ".sas" suffix (or other, if
specified in ess-site).  The batch processing keypress commands are
enabled by default to use the same function keys that the SAS Display
Manager uses.  The interactive capabilities of ESS require you to
start an inferior SAS process with M-x SAS
(See section <A HREF="ess.html#SEC61">iESS[SAS]--Inferior ESS processes</A>.)

<H2><A NAME="SEC62" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC62">ESS[SAS]--Batch processes</A></H2>

<P>
Submission of a SAS batch job is dependent on your environment.  
ess-sas-submit-method is determined by your operating system and your shell.
It defaults to 'sh unless you are running Windows or Mac Classic.  Under Windows,
it will default to 'sh if you are using bash for your shell rather than
MS-DOS ('ms-dos).  On Mac OS X, it will default to 'sh, but under Mac Classic 
AppleScript is used ('apple-script).  You will also set this to 'sh if the SAS batch 
job needs to run on a remote machine rather than your local machine.  This works
transparently if you are editing the remote file via ange-ftp/EFS or tramp.  
However, if you are editing the file locally and transferring it back and forth
with Kermit, you need some additional steps.  First of all, start Kermit locally
before remotely logging in.  Execute the command ess-kermit-get.  A local copy
of the file will be created with the ess-kermit-prefix character prepended (the
default is ":").  Also, note that the remote Kermit command is defined by
ess-kermit-command.  


<P>
The command used by the SUBMIT function key (F3 or F8) to submit a batch SAS 
job, whether local or remote, is ess-sas-submit-command which defaults to sas-program.  sas-program is 
"invoke SAS using program file" for Mac Classic and "sas" otherwise.  However, 
you may have to alter ess-sas-submit-command for a particular program, so it is 
defined as buffer-local (conveniently, you can set it in Local Variables: at 
the end of your program).  The command line is also made of 
ess-sas-submit-pre-command, ess-sas-submit-post-command and 
ess-sas-submit-command-options (the last of which is also buffer-local).
Here are some examples for your .emacs file (you may also use custom-ize):

<PRE>
(setq ess-sas-submit-pre-command "nohup")                 ;'sh default
(setq ess-sas-submit-post-command "-rsasuser &#38;")          ;'sh default
(setq ess-sas-submit-command "/usr/local/sas/sas")        ;'sh example
(setq ess-sas-submit-pre-command "start")                 ;'ms-dos default
(setq ess-sas-submit-post-command "-rsasuser -icon")      ;'ms-dos default
(setq ess-sas-submit-command "c:/progra~1/sas/sas.exe")   ;Windows example
(setq ess-sas-submit-command "c:\\progra~1\\sas\\sas.exe");Windows example
</PRE>

<P>
There is a built-in delay before a batch SAS job is submitted when using
a Unix shell under either Unix or Windows.  This is necessary in many cases 
since the shell might not be ready to receive a command.  This delay is 
currently set high enough so as not to be a problem on any system.  But,
there may be cases when it needs to be set higher, or could be set much
lower to speed things up.  You can over-ride the default in your .emacs
file by (the default of 5 seconds is shown):

<H2><A NAME="SEC63" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC63">ESS[SAS]--Function keys for batch processing</A></H2>

<P>
The description of the setup for function keys for batch processing of
SAS files is unavoidably more complex than we wish it were.  The actual
use of the function keys is simple.  There are five distinct options:


<P>
1. (default) Function keys in ESS[SAS] modes do whatever they normally
do in other emacs modes.  Many users will have defined some of the
keys [f2]-[f12] in their .emacs or _emacs file, or will have
installation-wide definitions in their site-start.el file.  By
default, ESS does not override those definitions.  This default is
intended to make ESS[SAS] mode behave similarly to other emacs modes.


<P>
2,3,4,5.
Users who are primarily familiar with SAS, and who are learning emacs
as a way to approach SAS, will likely want to duplicate the function
key capabilities that SAS Institute provides with its Display Manager.
There are still options.



<OL>
<LI>

SAS provides different function key
definitions with its PC and Unix products; ESS can use either.
<LI>

The ESS[SAS] function key definitions can be active in all buffers
(global) or limited (local) only to buffers that have SAS-related file
extensions: .sas, .log, .lst, filetype-1 (which defaults to .txt),
and filetype-2 which defaults to .dat.
</OL>

<P>
The distinction between local and global appears subtle.  If you want
the ESS[SAS] definitions to work when you are in *shell* or when
editing files other than the file extensions that SAS recognizes, you
will most likely want to use the global definitions.
If you want your function keys to understand SAS batch commands when you
are editing SAS files, and to behave normally when editing other files,
then you will choose the local definitions.


<P>
The option can be chosen by the person installing ESS for a site or by
an individual.



<OL>
<LI>

The site manager can uncomment only one of the following lines.
ESS[SAS] Function keys are available in ESS[SAS] and related modes if you
uncomment either of the following lines in your ess-site.el:

<PRE>
;;2; (setq ess-sas-local-unix-keys t)
;;3; (setq ess-sas-local-pc-keys t)
</PRE>

ESS[SAS] Function keys are available in all emacs modes if you
uncomment either of the following lines in your ess-site.el:

<PRE>
;;4; (setq ess-sas-global-unix-keys t)
;;5; (setq ess-sas-global-pc-keys t)
</PRE>

The names -unix- and -pc- have nothing to do with the operating system
that you are running.  Rather they mimic the definitions that the SAS
Display Manager uses by default on those platforms.

<LI>

The option can be selected by an individual by adding a line to the
.emacs (or _emacs) file, immediately following the

<PRE>
 (load "ess-site")
</PRE>

line.  If your site manager has chosen an option 2,3,4,5 you don't
want, you must turn it off before selecting a different option.  To
turn off an option, add the appropriate line (uncommented) to your
.emacs (_emacs) file.

<PRE>
;;2; (setq ess-sas-local-unix-keys nil)
;;3; (setq ess-sas-local-pc-keys nil)
;;4; (setq ess-sas-global-unix-keys nil)
;;5; (setq ess-sas-global-pc-keys nil)
</PRE>

</OL>

<P>
Finally, we get to what the function keys actually do.  You may recognize
some of the Short Names as SAS Display Manager commands (they
are in all capitals).



<PRE>
Unix PC     Short Name  Long Description

F2   F2     refresh     revert the current buffer with the file of the 
                        same name if the file is newer than the buffer.

F3   F8     SUBMIT      save the current .sas file (which is either the
                        .sas file in the current buffer or the .sas
                        file associated with the .lst or .log file in the
                        current buffer) and submit the file as a batch 
                        SAS job.

C-F3 C-F8   SUBMIT-REGION Write region to temporary file,
                        and submit to SAS.

F4   F5     PROGRAM     switch buffer to .sas file.

F5   F6     LOG         switch buffer to .log file, `refresh' and goto 
                        next error message, if any.

C-F5 C-F6   APPEND-TO-LOG Append ess-temp.log to the current .log file.

F6   F7     OUTPUT      switch buffer to .lst file and `refresh'.

C-F6 C-F7   APPEND-TO-OUTPUT Append ess-temp.lst to the current .lst file.

F7   F4     filetype-1  switch buffer to filetype-1 (defaults to .txt) 
                        file and `refresh'.

F8   F3     shell       switch buffer to shell.

F9   F9     VIEWTABLE   open an interactive FSEDIT/FSBROWSE session
                        on the SAS dataset near point

F10  F10    toggle-log  toggle ESS[SAS] for .log files; may be useful
                        for certain debugging situations

F11  F11    filetype-2  switch buffer to filetype-2 (defaults to .dat) 
                        file and refresh.

F12  F12    viewgraph   open a GSASFILE near point for viewing either
                        in emacs or with an external viewer
</PRE>

<P>
Besides the keys that mimic SAS Display Manager commands, six other keys
have been provided for convenience.


<P>
`shell' switches you to the *shell* 
buffer where you can type operating system commands.  This is especially
helpful if you would like to kill a SAS batch job.  


<P>
F2 performs the `refresh' 
operation on the current buffer.  `refresh' compares the buffer date/time stamp 
with the file date/time stamp and replaces the buffer with the file if the 
file is newer.  This is the same operation that is automatically performed
when LOG, OUTPUT, `filetype-1' or `filetype-2' are pressed.


<P>
`filetype-1' switches
you to a file with the same file root as your .sas file, but with a different 
extension; .txt by default.  
You can over-ride the default, by specifying a different extension 
in your .emacs file.  For example, for `filetype-1': 

<PRE>
(setq ess-sas-suffix-1 "txt")
</PRE>

<P>
`filetype-2' is similar, except it is .dat by default.  


<P>
F10 toggles ESS[SAS] mode for .log files which is off by default (technically, 
it is SAS-log-mode, but it looks the same).  The syntax highlighting can be 
helpful in certain debugging situations, but large .log files will take a long 
time to render.  


<P>
F12 will open a GSASFILE near point for viewing either with
emacs or with an external viewer.  Depending on your version of emacs and
the operating system you are using, emacs may support .gif and .jpg files
internally.  You may need to change the following two variables for your
own situation:

<PRE>
(setq ess-sas-graph-suffix-regexp "[.]\\(e?ps\\|gif\\|jpe?g\\|tiff?\\)")
(setq ess-sas-image-viewer "kodakimg") ;; external viewer
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC64" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC64">ESS[SAS]--TAB key</A></H2>

<P>
Again, two options.


<P>
The TAB key is bound by default to sas-indent-line.  This function is
used to syntactically indent SAS code so PROC and RUN are in the left
margin, other statements are indented 4 spaces from the margin,
continuation lines are indented 4 spaces in from the beginning column
of that statement.  This is the type of functionality that emacs
provides in most programming language modes.  This functionality is
equivalent to uncommenting the following line in ess-site.el:

<PRE>
;;; (setq ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle 0)
</PRE>

<P>
ESS provides an alternate behavior for the TAB key that makes it
behave as it does on non-emacs terminals, i.e. move the cursor to the
next tab stop.  The alternate behavior also provides a backwards TAB
key: C-TAB.  This functionality is obtained by uncommenting the
following line in ess-site.el:

<PRE>
;;; (setq ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle 1)
</PRE>

<P>
Under the alternate behavior, the TAB key is bound to tab-to-tab-stop
and the tab stops are set by default at multiples of 4.

<PRE>
    ## Find the file you want to work with

    ## notification when the job is complete.  If so, then you 
    ## will also have the option of terminating the batch job
    ## before it is finished.
    ## -pc- F3

<P>
Interactive SAS

<PRE>
    ## Find the file you want to work with
    C-x C-f myfile.sas
    ## myfile.sas will be in ESS[SAS] mode

    ## Edit as appropriate, and then start up SAS with the cursor in
    ## the myfile.sas buffer
    M-x SAS

    ## Four buffers will appear on screen:
    ## myfile.sas  in  ESS[SAS]        mode # your source file
    ## *SAS:1*     in  iESS [SAS:1]    mode # ESS communication buffer
    ## *SAS:1.log* in  Shell [] ESStr  mode # SAS log information
    ## *SAS:1.lst* in  Shell [] ESSlst mode # SAS listing information

    ## If you would prefer each of the four buffers to appear in its
    ## own individual frame, you can arrange for that.  Place the
    ## cursor in the buffer displaying myfile.sas.  Enter the
    ## sequence:
    C-c C-w

    ## The cursor will normally be in buffer myfile.sas.
    ## If not, put it there:
    C-x b myfile.sas

    ## Send regions, lines, or the entire file contents to SAS
    ## (regions are most useful).  A highlighted region will normally
    ## begin with the keywords 'DATA' or 'PROC' and end with the
    ## keyword 'RUN;'
    C-c C-r

    ## Information appears in the log buffer, analysis results in the
    ## listing buffer.  In case of errors, make the corrections in the
    ## myfile.sas buffer and resubmit with another C-c C-r

    ## PROC GPLOT graphs will normally be produced in a postscript
    ## file and be viewed later.  Include the lines
    /* required gsoptions for batch files */
    /* comment out these lines for interactive use on X-terminals*/
    filename grafout 'temp.ps';
    goptions device=ps gsfname=grafout gsfmode=append gaccess=sasgastd;
    ## in myfile.sas.

    ## PROC PLOT graphs can be viewed in the listing buffer.  You may
    ## wish to control the vertical spacing to allow the entire plot
    ## to be visible on screen, for example, by
    proc plot; plot a*b / vpos=25;

    ## At the end of the session you may save the log and listing
    ## buffers with the usual C-x C-s commands.  You will be prompted
    ## for a file name.  Typically, the names myfile.log and mfile.lst
    ## will be used.  You will almost certainly want to edit the saved
    ## files before including them in a report.  The files are
    ## read-only by default.  You can make them writable by the emacs
    ## command C-x C-q.

    ## At the end of the session, the input file myfile.sas will
    ## typically have been revised.  You can save it.  It can be used
    ## later as the beginning of another iESS[SAS] session.  It can
    ## also be used as a batch input file to SAS.

    ## The *SAS:1* buffer is strictly for ESS use.  The user should
    ## never need to read it or write to it.  Refer to the .lst and
    ## .log buffers for monitoring output!

<H2><A NAME="SEC66" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC66">ESS[SAS]--Common problems</A></H2>


<PRE>
1. MS Windows users.
   - M-x SAS does not work on MS Windows.  In order to run SAS inside
   an Emacs buffer it is necessary to start SAS with the -stdio option.
   SAS does not support the -stdio option on Windows.

2. If M-x SAS gives weird errors upon startup, check the following:
   - you are running Windows:  SAS does not support stdio on Windows
   - ess-sas-sh-command (in the ESS source directory) needs to be
     executable (solution: "chmod ugo+rx ess-sas-sh-command").
   - sas isn't in your executable path (verify using "which sas" from
     a shell command-line)
   - you need a copy of SAS (we can't solve this)

3. M-x SAS starts up SAS in the window system (motif, for example),
   instead of starting it up in the emacs buffers.

   Probably the unix command "sas" on your system calls a local
   script which in turn calls the sas executable.  The fix is to
   call the sas executable directly.

   Change the line in ess-sas-sh command from:

<PRE>
sas &#60;/dev/tty 1&#62;$stdout 2&#62;$stderr $
</PRE>

   to a call to the complete path name of the sas executable on
   your system, for example:

<PRE>
/usr/local/sas612/sas &#60;/dev/tty 1&#62;$stdout 2&#62;$stderr $
</PRE>

   To find the complete path name on your system, you can
   execute the line (from the unix prompt):

<PRE>
find / -name 'sas' -exec ls -ld {} \;
</PRE>

   and expect a response similar to the following

<PRE>
-rwxr-xr-x   1 sas  sas  2441216 Sep  9  1997 /usr/local/sas612/sas

(GNU Emacs uses <TT>`$HOME/.emacs'</TT> and XEmacs uses <TT>`$HOME/.xemacs/init.el'</TT>
for the user initialization file.  GNU Emacs uses default.el or site-init.el and 
XEmacs uses site-start.el for the system installation file). 

Alternatively, if ess-site.el is in your current Lisp path, you can do:

If this works, then you might try:

<PRE>
make install

<TT>`c:\emacs\ess-@essver{'</TT>.tar.gz}, and cd there.  For example,


<PRE>
cd c:\emacs
</PRE>

Extract the files from the distribution, which will unpack
into a subdirectory, <TT>`ess-@essver{'</TT>}.

<PRE>
gunzip ess-@essver{}.tar.gz
tar xvf ess-@essver{}.tar
(or: <CODE>gunzip &#60; ess-@essver{</CODE>.tar.gz | tar xvf -} ).
(or: from the zip file: <CODE>unzip ess-@essver{</CODE>.zip})
</PRE>

The <CODE>tar</CODE> command will extract files into the current directory.

Do not create <TT>`ess-@essver{'</TT>} yourself, or you will get an extra level
of depth to your directory structure.

<LI>

Windows users will usually be able to use the `lisp/ess-site.el'
as distributed.  Only rarely will changes be needed.

<LI>

Windows users will need to make sure that the directories for the
software they will be using is in the PATH environment variable.  On
Windows 9x, add lines similar to the following to your
<TT>`c:\autoexec.bat'</TT> 
file:

<PRE>
path=%PATH%;c:\progra~1\spls2000\cmd
</PRE>

On Windows NT/2000, add the directories to the PATH using the
MyComputer menu.  Note that the directory containing the program is
added to the PATH, not the program itself.  One such line is needed
for each software program.  Be sure to use the abbreviation
<CODE>progra~1</CODE> and not the long version with embedded blanks.  Use
backslashes "\".

<LI>

Add the line 

<PRE>
(load "/PATH/ess-site")
</PRE>

to your .emacs (or _emacs) file (or default.el or site-init.el, for
a site-wide installation).  Replace <CODE>/PATH</CODE> above with the
value of ess-lisp-directory as defined in <TT>`ess-site.el'</TT>.  Use
forwardslashes <CODE>/</CODE>.
(GNU Emacs uses the filename <TT>`%HOME%/.emacs'</TT> and
XEmacs uses the filename <TT>`%HOME%/.xemacs/init.el'</TT>
for the initialization file.)

<LI>

To edit statistical programs, load the files with the requisite
extensions  (".sas" for SAS, ".S" or "s" or "q" or "Q" for S-PLUS,
".r" or ".R" for R, and ".lsp"   for XLispStat).

<LI>

To run statistical processes under emacs:

Run S-PLUS 6.x or 2000 with:

<PRE>
M-x S+6
(or <CODE>M-x S</CODE>).
</PRE>

You will then be
asked for a pathname ("S starting data directory?"), from which to
start the process.  The prompt will propose your current directory
as the default.  Similarly for S-PLUS 6.x.  Send lines or regions
from the emacs buffer containing your S program (for example,
<TT>`myfile.s'</TT>) to the S-Plus Commands Window with the 
<CODE>C-c C-n</CODE> or <CODE>C-c C-r</CODE> keys.

Run S-PLUS 6.x or 2000 inside an emacs buffer

<PRE>
M-x Sqpe+6
</PRE>

You will then be asked for a pathname ("S starting data
directory?"), from which to start the process.  The prompt will
propose your current directory as the default.  Similarly for S-PLUS
6.x.  Send lines or regions from the emacs buffer containing your S
program (for example, <TT>`myfile.s'</TT>) to the *S+6* buffer with the
<CODE>C-c C-n</CODE> or <CODE>C-c C-r</CODE> keys.  You do not have access to
interactive graphics in 
this mode.  You get Unix-like behavior, in particular the entire
transcript is available for emacs-style search commands.

If you wish to run R, you can start it with:

<PRE>
M-x R
</PRE>

XLispStat can not currently be run with

<PRE>
M-x XLS
</PRE>

Hopefully, this will change.  However, you can still edit with
emacs, and cut and paste the results into the XLispStat
*Listener* Window under Microsoft Windows.

SAS for Windows uses the batch access with function keys that is
described in <TT>`doc/README.SAS'</TT>.  The user can also edit SAS files
in an <CODE>ESS[SAS]</CODE> buffer and than manually copy and paste them into
an Editor window in the SAS Display Manager.

For Windows, inferior SAS in an <CODE>iESS[SAS]</CODE> buffer does not work
on the local machine.  It does work over a network connection to
SAS running on a remote Unix computer.

Reason:  we use ddeclient to interface with programs and SAS doesn't
provide the corresponding ddeserver capability.

<LI>

(OPTIONAL) If you are running Sqpe or R, you might consider
installing the database files.  From within emacs, <CODE>C-x d</CODE> to
the   directory containing ESS.  Now:

<PRE>
M-x Sqpe+6
</PRE>

(get running.  once you have reached the SPLUS prompt, do:)

<PRE>
M-x ess-create-object-name-db
</PRE>

(this will create the file <TT>`ess-s+6-namedb.el'</TT>; if it isn't in the
ESS directory, move it there).

Then, completions will be autoloaded and will not be regenerated
for every session.

For R, do the same, using

<PRE>
M-x R
</PRE>

and then <CODE>M-x ess-create-object-name-db</CODE> creating
<TT>`ess-r-namedb.el'</TT>; if it isn't in the ESS directory, move it
there).

<LI>That's it!

</UL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC72" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC72">Other variables you may need to change</A></H2>

<P>
If you run the <B>S</B> program (from the shell) with a command other than
<SAMP>`Splus'</SAMP> you will need to set the variable
<CODE>inferior-ess-program</CODE>
<A NAME="IDX207"></A>
to the name of the appropriate program by including a line such as
<A NAME="IDX208"></A>
<A NAME="IDX209"></A>
<A NAME="IDX210"></A>

<PRE>
(setq inferior-ess-program "S+")
</PRE>

<P>
in your <TT>`.emacs'</TT> file
<A NAME="IDX211"></A>
(substituting <SAMP>`S+'</SAMP> for the name of your <B>S</B> program.)


<P>
If you need to call this program with any arguments, the variable you
<A NAME="IDX212"></A>
need to set is dependent on the value of <CODE>inferior-ess-program</CODE>; for
example if it is <CODE>"Splus"</CODE>, set the variable
<CODE>inferior-Splus-args</CODE>
<A NAME="IDX213"></A>
to a string of arguments to the <CODE>Splus</CODE> program.  If
<CODE>inferior-ess-program</CODE> has some other value, substitute the
<CODE>Splus</CODE> part of <CODE>inferior-Splus-args</CODE> with the appropriate
program name.  There aren't many instances where you need to call <B>S</B>
with arguments, however: in particular do not call the <B>S</B> program
with the <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP> command-line editor argument since ESS provides this
feature for you.


<P>
<A NAME="IDX214"></A>
<A NAME="IDX215"></A>
If you are running Splus (the enhanced version of <B>S</B> from Statsci) you
may also need to set the variable <CODE>S-plus</CODE> to <CODE>t</CODE>.  If your
value of <CODE>inferior-ess-program</CODE> is <CODE>"S+"</CODE> or <CODE>Splus</CODE> this
will not be necessary, however; <CODE>S-plus</CODE> defaults to <CODE>t</CODE> in
this case.


<P>
Finally, if you use a non-standard prompt within S, you will need to set the
variable <CODE>inferior-ess-prompt</CODE>
<A NAME="IDX216"></A>
<A NAME="IDX217"></A>
to a regular expression which will match both the primary prompt (<CODE>"&#62; "</CODE>
<A NAME="IDX218"></A>
by default) and the continuing prompt (default of <CODE>"+ "</CODE>.) The
<A NAME="IDX219"></A>
default value of this variable matches S's default prompts.  For example,
if you use (<CODE>"$ "</CODE>) as your primary prompt (you have
<CODE>options(prompt="$ ")</CODE> in your <CODE>.First</CODE> function), add the
<A NAME="IDX220"></A>
<A NAME="IDX221"></A>
following line to your <TT>`.emacs'</TT>:

<PRE>
(setq inferior-ess-prompt "^\\(\\+\\|[^\\$]*\\$\\) *")
</PRE>

<P>
You will also need to set the variable <CODE>inferior-ess-primary-prompt</CODE>
<A NAME="IDX222"></A>
to a regular expression which matches the primary prompt only.  Do not
anchor the regexp to the beginning of the line with <SAMP>`^'</SAMP>.  Once
again, the default value matches S's default prompt; in the example
above the appropriate value would be <CODE>"[^\\$]*\\$ *"</CODE>.


<P>
Once these variables are set appropriately, ESS should work on any
system.
