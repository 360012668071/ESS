<H1><A NAME="SEC59" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC59">Manipulating saved transcript files</A></H1>

<P>
Inferior <B>S</B> mode records the transcript (the list of all commands
executed, and their output) in the process buffer, which can be saved as
a <EM>transcript file</EM>, which should normally have the suffix
<TT>`.St'</TT>.  The most obvious use for a transcript file is as a static
record of the actions you have performed in a particular <B>S</B> session.
Sometimes, however, you may wish to re-execute commands recorded in the
transcript file by submitting them to a running <B>ESS</B> process.  This
is what Transcript Mode is for.


<P>
If you load file a with the suffix <TT>`.St'</TT> into Emacs, it is placed
in S Transcript Mode.  Transcript Mode is similar to Inferior <B>S</B> mode
(see section <A HREF="ess_6.html#SEC35">Interacting with the <B>ESS</B> process</A>):
<A NAME="IDX207"></A>
<A NAME="IDX208"></A>
paragraphs are defined as a command and its output, and you can move
though commands either with the paragraph commands or with <KBD>C-c C-p</KBD>
and <KBD>C-c C-n</KBD>.

<H2><A NAME="SEC60" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC60">Resubmitting commands from the transcript file</A></H2>

<P>
Three commands are provided to re-submit command lines from the
transcript file to a running <B>ESS</B> process.  They are:



<UL>
<LI>

<KBD>RET</KBD> (<CODE>ess-transcript-send-command</CODE>) <BR>
Send the current command line to the <B>ESS</B> process, and execute it.
<A NAME="IDX209"></A>

<LI>

<KBD>C-c RET</KBD> (<CODE>ess-transcript-copy-command</CODE>) <BR>
Copy the current command to the <B>ESS</B> process, and switch to the
<B>ESS</B> process buffer (ready to edit the copied command).
<A NAME="IDX210"></A>

<LI>

<KBD>M-RET</KBD> (<CODE>ess-transcript-send-command-and-move</CODE>) <BR>
Send the current command to the <B>ESS</B> process, and move to the next
command line.  This command is useful for submitting a series of
commands.
</UL>

<P>
Note that these commands are similar to those on the same keys in
Inferior <B>S</B> Mode.  In all three cases, the commands should be
executed when the cursor is on a command line in the transcript; the
prompt is automatically removed before the command is submitted.




<H2><A NAME="SEC61" HREF="ess_toc.html#TOC61">Cleaning transcript files</A></H2>

<P>
Yet another use for transcript files is to extract the command lines for
inclusion in an <B>S</B> source file or function.  Transcript mode provides
one command which does just this:



<UL>
<LI>

<KBD>C-c C-w</KBD> (<CODE>ess-transcript-clean-region</CODE>) <BR>
Deletes all prompts and command output in the region, leaving only the
commands themselves.
</UL>

<P>
The remaining command lines may then be copied to a source file or edit
buffer for inclusion in a function definition, or may be evaluated
directly (see section <A HREF="ess_7.html#SEC53">Sending code to the <B>ESS</B> process</A>) using the code evaluation commands
from <B>S</B> mode, also available in <B>S</B> Transcript Mode.
