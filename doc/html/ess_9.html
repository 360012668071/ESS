<P>
ESS provides an easy-to-use facility for reading <B>S</B> help files from
within Emacs.  From within the <B>ESS</B> process buffer or any ESS edit
buffer, typing <KBD>C-c C-v</KBD> (<CODE>ess-display-help-on-object</CODE>)
<A NAME="IDX195"></A>
will prompt you for the name of an object for which you would like
documentation.  Completion is provided over all objects which have help
files.


<P>
If the requested object has documentation, you will be popped into a
buffer (named <CODE>*help(<VAR>obj-name</VAR>)*</CODE>) containing the help file.
This buffer is placed in a special `S Help' mode which disables the
usual editing commands but which provides a number of keys for paging
through the help file:



<UL>
Help commands:

<LI>

<KBD>?</KBD> (<CODE>ess-describe-help-mode</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX196"></A>
Pops up a help buffer with a list of the commands available in <B>S</B> help
mode.

<LI>

<KBD>h</KBD> (<CODE>ess-display-help-on-object</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX197"></A>
Pop up a help buffer for a different object

Paging commands:

<A NAME="IDX198"></A>
<LI>

<KBD>b</KBD> or <KBD>DEL</KBD> (<CODE>scroll-down</CODE>) <BR>
Move one page backwards through the help file.

<LI>

<KBD>SPC</KBD> (<CODE>scroll-up</CODE>) <BR>
Move one page forwards through the help file.

<LI>

<KBD>&#62;</KBD> (<CODE>beginning-of-buffer</CODE>) and <KBD>&#60;</KBD> (<CODE>end-of-buffer</CODE>)
<BR>
Move to the beginning and end of the help file, respectively.

Section-based motion commands:

<LI>

<KBD>n</KBD> (<CODE>ess-skip-to-next-section</CODE>) and <KBD>p</KBD>
(<CODE>ess-skip-to-previous-section</CODE>) <BR> Move to the next and previous
<A NAME="IDX199"></A>
<A NAME="IDX200"></A>
section header in the help file, respectively.  A section header
consists of a number of capitalized words, followed by a colon.

In addition, the <KBD>s</KBD> key followed by one of the following letters
will jump to a particular section in the help file:

</DL>

Miscellaneous:

<LI>

<KBD>r</KBD> (<CODE>ess-eval-region</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX202"></A>
Send the contents of the current region to the <B>ESS</B> process.  Useful
for running examples in help files.

<LI>

<KBD>/</KBD> (<CODE>isearch-forward</CODE>) <BR>
Same as <KBD>C-s</KBD>.

Quit commands:

<LI>

<KBD>q</KBD> (<CODE>ess-switch-to-end-of-ESS</CODE>) <BR>
<A NAME="IDX203"></A>
Returns to the <B>ESS</B> process buffer in another window, leaving the
help window visible.

<LI>

<KBD>k</KBD> (<CODE>kill-buffer</CODE>) <BR>
Kills the help buffer.

<LI>

<KBD>x</KBD> (<CODE>ess-kill-buffer-and-go</CODE>) <BR>
Return to the <B>ESS</B> process, killing this help buffer.
</UL>

<P>
In addition, all of the ESS commands available in the edit buffers are
also available in <B>S</B> help mode (see section <A HREF="ess_8.html#SEC54">Creating or modifying <B>S</B> objects</A>).  Of course, the
usual (non-editing) Emacs commands are available, and for convenience
the digits and <KBD>-</KBD> act as prefix arguments.


<P>
If a help buffer already exists for an object for which help is
requested, that buffer is popped to immediately; the <B>ESS</B> process is
not consulted at all.  If the contents of the help file have changed,
you either need to kill the help buffer first, or pass a prefix argument
(with <KBD>C-u</KBD>) to <CODE>ess-display-help-on-object</CODE>.


<P>
Help buffers are marked as temporary buffers in ESS, and are deleted
when <CODE>ess-quit</CODE> or <CODE>ess-cleanup</CODE> are called.
