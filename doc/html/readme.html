<P>
This is the README file for the distribution of ESS version 
5.1.24


<P>
The final release of the 5.1.x series on the way to 5.2 (the next stable 
distribution).  ESS is a GNU Emacs and XEmacs mode for interactive
statistical programming and data analysis.  Languages supported:  the
S family (S 3/4, S-PLUS 3/4/5/6, and R), SAS, XLispStat, Stata and BUGS.
Installation help can be found in sections for both Unix and Windows.
ESS grew out of the desire for bug fixes and extensions to S-mode and 
SAS-mode as well as a consistent union of their features in one package.


<P>
The current development team is led by A.J. (Tony) Rossini
(<A HREF="mailto:rossini@biostat.washington.edu">rossini@biostat.washington.edu</A>), who did the initial port to
XEmacs and has been the primary coder.  Martin Maechler
(<A HREF="mailto:maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch">maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch</A>) and Kurt Hornik
(<A HREF="mailto:hornik@ci.tuwien.ac.at">hornik@ci.tuwien.ac.at</A>) have assisted with S-PLUS, S4, R, and
XLispStat.  Richard M. Heiberger (<A HREF="mailto:rmh@surfer.sbm.temple.edu">rmh@surfer.sbm.temple.edu</A>) has 
assisted with S-PLUS and S4 development for Windows.  Richard and 
Rodney A. Sparapani (<A HREF="mailto:rsparapa@mcw.edu">rsparapa@mcw.edu</A>) have done much of the work 
implementing interactive SAS (iESS[SAS]) and batch SAS (ESS[SAS]) support.  


<P>
We are grateful to the previous developers of S-mode (Doug Bates, Ed Kademan,
Frank Ritter, David M. Smith), SAS-mode (Tom Cook) and Stata-mode (Thomas 
Lumley).

<P>
Changes/New Features in 5.2.0:

<UL>
<LI>ESS[BUGS]:  now supports interactive processing; special thanks to

<A HREF="mailto:Aki.Vehtari@hut.fi">Aki Vehtari</A>; new info documentation!
<LI>ESS[SAS]:  convert .log to .sas with ess-sas-transcript; THEN statements now highlighted correctly; info documentation improved; Local Variables bug fixes

</UL>

<P>
Changes/New Features in 5.1.24:

<UL>
<LI>The version number is now correct even inside ESS/Emacs

</UL>

<P>
Changes/New Features in 5.1.23:

<UL>
<LI>Minor more Makefile clean up.

</UL>

<P>
Changes/New Features in 5.1.22:

<UL>
<LI>Besides info documentation, PDF and HTML

documentation are also provided (instead of built using "make") and available
on the web as well; see <A HREF="http://software.biostat.washington.edu/ess/doc">ESS web page</A> and <A HREF="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/general/ESS/doc">StatLib</A>
<LI>Now that info documentation is available, the

README.* files are no longer supported.  However, they
are still distributed for what it's worth.
<LI>ESS is now an XEmacs package!  See

<A HREF="http://www.xemacs.org/Install/index.html">XEmacs Installation HOWTO</A>
for details (specifically, items 10-15).
<LI>ESS[SAS]: more user-friendly enhancements for remote

SAS batch jobs with Kermit file transfers (LOG and OUTPUT
function key features now supported).  Multiple shells
now supported so you can run SAS on different computers
from different buffers by setting the buffer-local variable
ess-sas-shell-buffer to unique buffer names.
<LI>Major re-vamping of Makefile/Makeconf.

</UL>

<P>
Changes/New Features in 5.1.21:

<UL>
<LI>ESS[SAS]: info documentation now available!, see

ESS-&#62;Help for SAS; F12 opens GSASFILE nearest point for viewing
either within emacs, when available, or via an external viewer;
more syntax highlighting keywords; more enhancements for remote
SAS batch jobs with Kermit; new framework for remote SAS interactive
jobs, see ess-remote
<LI>ESS[S]: info documentation now available!, see

ESS-&#62;Help for the S family
<LI>Makefile: tag now independent of rel; info files

made by doc/Makefile and installed in new info sub-directory
</UL>

<P>
Changes/New Features in 5.1.20:

<UL>
<LI>New `options()$STERM' in the S dialects (S, S-Plus, R).

The S program can determine the environment in which it is
currently running.  ESS sets the option to `iESS' or `ddeESS'
when it starts an S language process.  We recommend other specific
values for S language processes that ESS does not start.
<LI>New `ess-mouse-me' function, assigned to S-mouse-3 by default.

User may click on a word or region and then choose from the
menu to display the item, or a summary, or a plot, etc.
This feature is still under development.
<LI>GNU Emacs 21.1 is now supported (fixed for S dialects, SAS &#38; BUGS),

(some from Stephen Eglen).
<LI>XEmacs 21.x is now supported (fixed w32-using-nt bug)

<LI>XEmacs on Win (NT) is better supported.

<LI>Workaround for bug in Sqpe+6 (S-PLUS 6 for Win).

<LI>should now work even when imenu is not available (for old Xemacsen).

<LI>ESS[SAS]: XEmacs-Imenu fix; C-TAB is globalized along with your

function-key definitions, if specified; you can specify your SAS
library definitions outside of autoexec.sas for ess-sas-data-view
with SAS code placed in the variable ess-sas-data-view-libname,
also the dataset name is defaulted to the nearest permanent dataset
to point; Speedbar support now works for permanent datasets, please
ignore first./last.; new font-locking is now the default with more
improvements for font-locking PROCs, macro statements, * ; and %* ;
comments; you can toggle sas-log-mode with F10 which will font-lock
your .log (if it isn't too big); submit remote .sas files accessed
with ange-ftp, EFS or Tramp (Kermit is experimental) by setting
ess-sas-submit-method to 'sh; ess-sas-submit-command and
ess-sas-submit-command-options are buffer-local so you can have
local file variable sections at the end of your .sas files to
request different executables or specify special options and the
local file variables are re-read at submit instead of only at file
open so that if you make a change it is picked up immediately;
<LI>ESS[BUGS]: font-lock with `in' fixed.

<LI>for STATA: font-lock bug fixed.

<LI>for Rd mode: C-c C-v and `switch-process' in menu.

further, C-c C-f prefix (Rd-font) for inserting or surrounding a word
by things such as \code{.}, \code{\link{.}}, \emph{.} etc.
<LI>new functions (ess-directory-function) and (ess-narrow-to-defun)

ess-directory &#60;-&#62; default-directory logic (Jeff Mincy).
<LI>Re-organized Makefile and fixed a few bugs.

</UL>

<P>
Changes/New Features in 5.1.19:

<UL>
<LI>S+6 now supported (Tony Rossini (Unix) and Rich Heiberger (Windows))

<LI>New BUGS support through ESS[BUGS] mode (Rodney Sparapani)

Templates assist you in writing .bug and .cmd code (.cmd and .log
are replaced by .bmd and .bog to avoid emacs extension collisions).
Substitution" parameters facilitate "automagic" generation of
data...in" and "init...in" filenames, "const N=" from your data
file and "monitor()/stats()" commands.  Activated by pressing F12.
<LI>Fixes for `ess-smart-underscore' SAS breakage (Rich Heiberger)

<LI>You can change between PC and Unix, local and global SAS function-key

definitions interactively (Rich Heiberger)
<LI>C-Submit a highlighted region to SAS batch (Rodney Sparapani)

<LI>New and improved SAS syntax highlighting (Rodney Sparapani)

To get the new functionality, set ess-sas-run-make-regexp to nil.
Also available in .log files via F10.
<LI>Open a permanent SAS dataset for viewing via F9 (Rodney Sparapani)

You must have the library defined in autoexec.sas for it to work.
<LI>User-friendly defaults for `sas-program', `ess-sas-batch-pre-command'

and `ess-sas-batch-post-command' as well Customize support for these
and other ESS[SAS] variables (Rodney Sparapani)
<LI>`ess-sas-suffix-2' now defaults to .dat via F11 (Rodney Sparapani)

<LI>Emacs/XEmacs, Unix/Windows issues collectively handled in ess-emcs.el

<LI>defadvice solves problem of missing *ESS* (thanks to Jeff Mincy)

<LI>Improved manual a bit by including things that were only in `README'.

</UL>

<P>
Changes/New Features in 5.1.18:

<UL>
<LI>New `ess-smart-underscore' function, now assigned to "_" by default.

Inserts `ess-S-assign' (customizable " &#60;- "), unless inside string
and comments where plain "_" is used instead. (MM)
<LI>Fixes for longstanding interactive SAS breakage (RMH)

</UL>

<P>
Changes/New Features in 5.1.17:

<UL>
<LI>Documentation for Windows Installation (Rich Heiberger)

<LI>removal of ess-vars, finalization of customize support (in the

sense that there is no more use of ess-vars, but that we need to
fix ess-cust) (AJ Rossini)
<LI>Many small (and large) fixes/contributions (MMaechler)

<LI>addition of the "S-equal" variable and provide M-x ess-add-MM-keys

a way to remap "_" to `ess-S-assign', typically " &#60;- ", but
customizable. (MMaechler)

<P>
Changes/New Features in 5.1.2:

<UL>
<LI>able to use inferior iESS mode to

communicate directly with a running S-Plus 4.x process using the
Microsoft DDE protocol.  We use the familiar (from Unix ESS) C-c C-n
and related key sequences to send lines from the S-mode file to the
inferior S process.  We continue to edit S input files in ESS[S] mode
and transcripts of previous S sessions in ESS Transcript mode.  All
three modes know the S language, syntax, and indentation patterns and
provide the syntactic highlighting that eases the programming tasks.

<OL>

<LI>

cd to a directory where you want to install ESS, creating it if necessary.
This directory will be referred to below as ESSDIR.  

<LI>

Retrieve the latest version from 
<A HREF="http://software.biostat.washington.edu/ess/ess-VERSION.tar.gz">gzipped tar file </A> 
to ESSDIR.

<LI>

Decompress/unarchive the files from the disribution.

<PRE>
gunzip ess-VERSION.tar.gz
tar xvf ess-VERSION.tar
</PRE>


<PRE>
(or: <CODE>gunzip &#60; ess-VERSION.tar.gz | tar xvf -</CODE> ).
(or using GNU tar:  <CODE>tar zxvf ess-VERSION.tar.gz</CODE>).
</PRE>

The <CODE>tar</CODE> command will create the subdirectory ess-VERSION and unarchive
the files there.

If you are using GNU Emacs 19.29, decompress/unarchive
<TT>`ESSDIR/ess-VERSION/lisp/19.29.tar.gz'</TT>, 
read <TT>`ESSDIR/ess-VERSION/lisp/19.29/README'</TT>, follow the instructions
and you might be able to get ESS to work.  
<EM>Please note that GNU Emacs 19.29 is no longer supported</EM>.
For a list of supported versions of emacs, see See section <A HREF="readme.html#SEC6">Requirements</A>.

<LI>

Edit the file <TT>`ESSDIR/ess-VERSION/lisp/ess-site.el'</TT> as explained in the 
comments section of that file.  

<LI>

 Add the line

<PRE>
(load "ESSDIR/ess-VERSION/lisp/ess-site")
</PRE>

to your user or system installation file
(GNU Emacs uses <TT>`$HOME/.emacs'</TT> and XEmacs uses <TT>`$HOME/.xemacs/init.el'</TT>
for the user initialization file.  GNU Emacs uses default.el or site-init.el and 
XEmacs uses site-start.el for the system installation file). 

Alternatively, if ess-site.el is in your current Lisp path, you can do:

<PRE>
(require 'ess-site)
</PRE>

to configure emacs for ESS.

<LI>

That's it!  To edit statistical programs, load the files with the requiste
extensions  (".sas" for SAS, ".S" for S-PLUS, ".R" for R, and ".lsp"
for XLispStat).

<LI>

(OPTIONAL) If you are running S-PLUS or R, you might consider
installing the database files.  From within emacs, <CODE>C-x d</CODE> to the
directory containing ESS.  Now:

<PRE>
M-x S+6
</PRE>

get running.  once you have reached the SPLUS
prompt, do: 

<PRE>
M-x ess-create-object-name-db
</PRE>

(this will create the file <TT>`ess-s+6-namedb.el'</TT>; if it isn't in the
ESS directory, move it there).

Then, completions will be autoloaded and will not be regenerated for
every session.

For R, do the same, using

<PRE>
M-x R
</PRE>

and then <CODE>M-x ess-create-object-name-db</CODE> creating
<TT>`ess-r-namedb.el'</TT>; if it isn't in the ESS directory, move it there).

<LI>

<B>(OPTIONAL) READ THIS ITEM THOROUGHLY BEFORE STARTING</B>:

In the ESSDIR/ess-VERSION directory, edit the file <TT>`Makeconf'</TT> if you
want to place the compiled files in other locations; see LISPDIR and INFODIR.

Then type:

<PRE>
make all
</PRE>

If this works, then you might try:

<PRE>
make install
</PRE>

This will install the info files (and the lisp files, if they are to go
in another directory).  Don't forget to edit the file <TT>`dir'</TT> in the
info directory specified by <CODE>INFODIR</CODE> in <TT>`doc/Makefile'</TT>.  See
the sample <TT>`dir'</TT> file for an example of the line to add.

If you are using XEmacs, you might do:

<PRE>
make EMACS=xemacs all
</PRE>

and then

<PRE>
make EMACS=xemacs install
</PRE>

instead of editing the Makefile.

<EM>Note</EM> that you might need to use <B>GNU make</B> for everything to
work properly

An alternative, if you are running XEmacs and have access to the
XEmacs system directories, would be to place the directory in the
site-lisp directory, and simply type <CODE>make all</CODE> (and copy the
documentation as appropriate).

For GNU Emacs, you would still have to move the files into the top level
site-lisp directory.

</OL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="readme_toc.html#TOC10">Microsoft Windows installation</A></H2>

<P>
For <B>Microsoft Windows installation</B>, please follow the next steps:
(see separate instructions above for UNIX See section <A HREF="readme.html#SEC9">Unix installation</A>.



<OL>

<LI>

cd to a directory where you keep emacs lisp files, or create a new
directory (for example, <TT>`c:\emacs\'</TT>) to hold the distribution.  This
directory will be referred to below as "the ESS distribution
directory".  It will contain, at the end, either the tar file
<TT>`ess-VERSION.tar.gz'</TT> or the zip file <TT>`ess-VERSION.zip'</TT>, and a
directory 
for the ESS source, which will be termed "the ESS-VERSION source
directory".

<LI>

Retrieve the compressed tar file <TT>`ess-VERSION.tar.gz'</TT> or the
zipped file <TT>`ess-VERSION.zip'</TT> from one of the FTP or WWW
archive sites 
via FTP (or HTTP).  Be aware that http browsers on Windows
frequently change the "." and "-" characters in filenames to other
punctuation.  Please change the names back to their original form.

<LI>

Copy <TT>`ess-VERSION.tar.gz'</TT> to the location where you want the
ess-VERSION directory, for example to
<TT>`c:\emacs\ess-VERSION.tar.gz'</TT>, and cd there.  For example,


<PRE>
cd c:\emacs
</PRE>

Extract the files from the distribution, which will unpack
into a subdirectory, <TT>`ess-VERSION'</TT>.

<PRE>
gunzip ess-VERSION.tar.gz
tar xvf ess-VERSION.tar
(or: <CODE>gunzip &#60; ess-VERSION.tar.gz | tar xvf -</CODE> ).
(or: from the zip file: <CODE>unzip ess-VERSION.zip</CODE>)
</PRE>

The <CODE>tar</CODE> command will extract files into the current directory.

Do not create <TT>`ess-VERSION'</TT> yourself, or you will get an extra level
of depth to your directory structure.

<LI>

Windows users will usually be able to use the `lisp/ess-site.el'
as distributed.  Only rarely will changes be needed.

<LI>

Windows users will need to make sure that the directories for the
software they will be using is in the PATH environment variable.  On
Windows 9x, add lines similar to the following to your
<TT>`c:\autoexec.bat'</TT> 
file:

<PRE>
path=%PATH%;c:\progra~1\spls2000\cmd
</PRE>

On Windows NT/2000, add the directories to the PATH using the
MyComputer menu.  Note that the directory containing the program is
added to the PATH, not the program itself.  One such line is needed
for each software program.  Be sure to use the abbreviation
<CODE>progra~1</CODE> and not the long version with embedded blanks.  Use
backslashes "\".

<LI>

Add the line 

<PRE>
(load "/PATH/ess-site")
</PRE>

to your .emacs (or _emacs) file (or default.el or site-init.el, for
a site-wide installation).  Replace <CODE>/PATH</CODE> above with the
value of ess-lisp-directory as defined in <TT>`ess-site.el'</TT>.  Use
forwardslashes <CODE>/</CODE>.
(GNU Emacs uses the filename <TT>`%HOME%/.emacs'</TT> and
XEmacs uses the filename <TT>`%HOME%/.xemacs/init.el'</TT>
for the initialization file.)

<LI>

To edit statistical programs, load the files with the requisite
extensions  (".sas" for SAS, ".S" or "s" or "q" or "Q" for S-PLUS,
".r" or ".R" for R, and ".lsp"   for XLispStat).

<LI>

To run statistical processes under emacs:

Run S-PLUS 6.x or 2000 with:

<PRE>
M-x S+6
(or <CODE>M-x S</CODE>).
</PRE>

You will then be
asked for a pathname ("S starting data directory?"), from which to
start the process.  The prompt will propose your current directory
as the default.  Similarly for S-PLUS 6.x.  Send lines or regions
from the emacs buffer containing your S program (for example,
<TT>`myfile.s'</TT>) to the S-Plus Commands Window with the 
<CODE>C-c C-n</CODE> or <CODE>C-c C-r</CODE> keys.

Run S-PLUS 6.x or 2000 inside an emacs buffer

<PRE>
M-x Sqpe+6
</PRE>

You will then be asked for a pathname ("S starting data
directory?"), from which to start the process.  The prompt will
propose your current directory as the default.  Similarly for S-PLUS
6.x.  Send lines or regions from the emacs buffer containing your S
program (for example, <TT>`myfile.s'</TT>) to the *S+6* buffer with the
<CODE>C-c C-n</CODE> or <CODE>C-c C-r</CODE> keys.  You do not have access to
interactive graphics in 
this mode.  You get Unix-like behavior, in particular the entire
transcript is available for emacs-style search commands.

If you wish to run R, you can start it with:

<PRE>
M-x R
</PRE>

XLispStat can not currently be run with

<PRE>
M-x XLS
</PRE>

Hopefully, this will change.  However, you can still edit with
emacs, and cut and paste the results into the XLispStat
*Listener* Window under Microsoft Windows.

SAS for Windows uses the batch access with function keys that is
described in <TT>`doc/README.SAS'</TT>.  The user can also edit SAS files
in an <CODE>ESS[SAS]</CODE> buffer and than manually copy and paste them into
an Editor window in the SAS Display Manager.

For Windows, inferior SAS in an <CODE>iESS[SAS]</CODE> buffer does not work
on the local machine.  It does work over a network connection to
SAS running on a remote Unix computer.

Reason:  we use ddeclient to interface with programs and SAS doesn't
provide the corresponding ddeserver capability.

<LI>

(OPTIONAL) If you are running Sqpe or R, you might consider
installing the database files.  From within emacs, <CODE>C-x d</CODE> to
the   directory containing ESS.  Now:

<PRE>
M-x Sqpe+6
</PRE>

(get running.  once you have reached the SPLUS prompt, do:)

<PRE>
M-x ess-create-object-name-db
</PRE>

(this will create the file <TT>`ess-s+6-namedb.el'</TT>; if it isn't in the
ESS directory, move it there).

Then, completions will be autoloaded and will not be regenerated
for every session.

For R, do the same, using

<PRE>
M-x R
</PRE>

and then <CODE>M-x ess-create-object-name-db</CODE> creating
<TT>`ess-r-namedb.el'</TT>; if it isn't in the ESS directory, move it
there).

<LI>That's it!

<P>
The easiest way to do this is within Emacs by typing


<P>
<KBD>M-x ess-submit-bug-report</KBD>


<P>
This also gives the maintainers valuable information about your
installation which may help us to identify or even fix the bug.


<P>
Note that comments, suggestions, words of praise and large cash
donations are also more than welcome.

"help") in the body to <A HREF="mailto:ess-help-request@stat.math.ethz.ch">ess-help-request@stat.math.ethz.ch</A>;
contributions to the list may be mailed to
<A HREF="mailto:ess-help@stat.math.ethz.ch">ess-help@stat.math.ethz.ch</A>.  Rest assured, this is a fairly
low-volume mailing list.


<P>
The purposes of the mailing list include



<UL>
<LI>

 helping users of ESS to get along with it.
<LI>

 discussing aspects of using ESS on Emacs and XEmacs.
