<h2 class="chapter">1 General Information: README</h2>

<p><a name="index-README-1"></a>
This is the README file for the distribution of ESS version

   <p>5.2.9

   <p>ESS is a GNU Emacs and XEmacs mode for interactive statistical programming
and data analysis.  Languages supported: the S family (S 3/4, S-PLUS
3/4/5/6/7, and R), SAS, XLispStat, Stata and BUGS.  Installation help can
be found in sections for both Unix and Windows.  ESS grew out of the desire
for bug fixes and extensions to S-mode and SAS-mode as well as a consistent
union of their features in one package.

   <p>The current development team is led by Martin Maechler since August
2004. Former project leader A.J. (Tony) Rossini
(<a href="mailto:rossini@blindglobe.net">rossini@blindglobe.net</a>) did the initial port to
XEmacs and has been the primary coder.  Martin Maechler
(<a href="mailto:maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch">maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch</a>) and Kurt Hornik
(<a href="mailto:Kurt.Hornik@R-project.org">Kurt.Hornik@R-project.org</a>) have assisted with S-PLUS, S4, R, and
XLispStat.  Stephen Eglen (<a href="mailto:stephen@gnu.org">stephen@gnu.org</a>) has worked mostly
on R support.  Richard M. Heiberger (<a href="mailto:rmh@temple.edu">rmh@temple.edu</a>) has
assisted with S-PLUS and S4 development for Windows.  Richard and
Rodney A. Sparapani (<a href="mailto:rsparapa@mcw.edu">rsparapa@mcw.edu</a>) have done much of the work
implementing interactive SAS (i<acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym><!-- /@w -->) and batch SAS (<acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym>) support.

   <p>We are grateful to the previous developers of S-mode (Doug Bates, Ed Kademan,
Frank Ritter, David M. Smith), SAS-mode (Tom Cook) and Stata-mode (Thomas
Lumley).

<h3 class="section">1.2 New Features</h3>

<p>Changes/New Features in 5.2.9:
     <ul>
<li><acronym>ESS[R]</acronym> for Windows:  the \ directory character bug
with respect to ess-load-file has been eradicated. 
<li>i<acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym><!-- /@w -->: <kbd>C-c C-r</kbd> and <kbd>C-c C-b</kbd> once again
work as intended and documented. 
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym>: M-x ess-fix-EQ-assign is a bit more agressive. 
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym>: Imenu now also shows setAs(), etc. 
<li><acronym>ESS[R]</acronym>: R function pattern enhanced with underlying code such that
 <kbd>M-C-a</kbd> (<code>ess-beginning-of-function</code>) etc now work for many more
 cases, including S4 method definitions. 
<li>i<acronym>ESS[R]</acronym><!-- /@w -->: myOwnhelp(1) no longer wrongly triggers help(1). 
<li><acronym>ESS[R]</acronym>: Improved detection of bogus help buffers: valid help
 buffers containing with the string &ldquo;no documentation&rdquo;(e.g. contour)
 were being treated as bogus. 
<li><acronym>ESS[R]</acronym>: In R help buffers, if <code>options("help.try.all.packages" =
 TRUE)</code> then <code>?rlm</code> will list which packages rlm is defined in.  This help
 buffer is not bogus, but instead is now relabelled &ldquo;*help[R](rlm in
 packages)*&rdquo;. 
<li><acronym>ESS[STA]</acronym>: add &ldquo;//&rdquo; as comment starting character to syntax-table. 
</ul>

   <p>Changes/New Features in 5.2.8:
     <ul>
<li>iESS: [Tab] completes <strong>file</strong> names &ldquo;inside string&rdquo; as in
earlier (&lt;= 5.2.3) ESS versions. 
</ul>

   <p>Changes/New Features in 5.2.7:
     <ul>
<li>If you use Custom to change the variable ess-toolbar-items,
the new toolbar is used in all subsequent ESS buffers. 
<li><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym>: new feature:  if ess-sas-log-max &gt;0 and
your .log grows to more than ess-sas-log-max bytes, just
the first ess-sas-log-max bytes are refreshed; this is helpful when your .sas program
generates lots of error messages and gets too big for emacs to display
<li><acronym>ESS[R/S]</acronym>: <kbd>M-;</kbd> in R/S editing modes will now indent with
either one or two hashes depending on context. 
<li><acronym>ESS[R]</acronym>: David Whiting's Sweave extensions (to 'noweb')
are now available (from ess-swv.el loaded by default). 
</ul>

   <p>Changes/New Features in 5.2.6:
     <ul>
<li>Removed non-ASCII characters in a few files. 
<li><acronym>ESS[R]</acronym>: now works better when UTF-8 locale is active; in
 particular, you get correct directional quotes in R's startup message
 for R-devel (unstable development version of R 2.1.0) when using
 environment variables LANGUAGE=en@quot LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
<li><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym>: toggling of .log mode improved (<kbd>F10</kbd>); toggling of
.lst mode now also available (<kbd>C-F10</kbd>); killing all buffers associated
with .sas program no longer bound to <kbd>C-F10</kbd> since its a bit overzealous. 
<li>S-Plus 7 for Windows is now recognized. 
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym> (incl. R): in auto-fill mode, strings are not wrapped anymore. 
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym> (incl. R): font-lock now correctly differs between R and S,
e.g., for "_"; both now fontify warning(.) and S does terminate() additionally. 
<li>Support for `bell' aka `beep' aka `ding' aka `alarm' in all inferior
modes: When \a is output &ldquo;to the the console&rdquo; at the beginning of a line,
the bell is rung. 
</ul>

   <p>Changes/New Features in 5.2.5:
     <ul>
<li><acronym>ESS[R]</acronym>: <kbd>C-c C-q</kbd> or <span class="samp">Quit S</span> from the menu now should work
(again and less klunkily) and do not append <span class="samp">-exited</span> to the
buffer name.  Further, the behavior of <code>(ess-cleanup)</code>, called from
ess-quit, now depends on the new customizable variable
<code>ess-S-quit-kill-buffers-p</code> which defaults to <code>nil</code>. 
Consequently, the question <em>&ldquo;Delete all buffers associated
with ..?&rdquo;</em> will not be asked anymore by default. 
<li><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym> &ndash; ess-ebcdic-to-ascii-search-and-replace will now work
with the <code>recode</code> application as well which is available on many platforms
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym> (incl. R): Name completion for slots of S4 objects now works! 
</ul>

   <p>Changes/New Features in 5.2.4:
     <ul>
<li>The documentation now includes an overview of how to use the emacs
TAGS facility for S functions.  (The distribution also used to contain a
directory <span class="file">etc/other/Tags</span> where a ~1990 version of <span class="file">etags.c</span> was
distributed; this is no longer relevant and so has been deleted.) 
<li><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym> &ndash; When you are working with EBCDIC files on an ASCII
platform, .log NOTEs may display as gibberish since the EBCDIC
characters are not converted to ASCII prior to their display.  So,
the function ess-ebcdic-to-ascii-search-and-replace is provided for
convenience and is bound to <kbd>C-F11</kbd>.  This function requires the
<code>dd</code> command (only available on unix or unix-like platforms). 
<li>ESS: Completion of object names is now always done dynamically rather
than allowing the option of using a pre-computed database (by
<code>ess-create-object-name-db</code>) since modern computers seem fast
enough for dynamic completion.  (We expect few users, if any, have
been using the pre-computed database method.) 
<li>ESS: object completion in iESS buffers running on Windows was
very slow (for GNU Emacs, but not XEmacs) and has now been fixed. 
Further, it was more or less broken for all versions of S-plus 6.x,
and has been fixed to work everywhere but with the Windows' GUI of
S-plus.  The list of objects now shows unique names also when an
object appears more than once in the search path. 
<li><acronym>ESS[R]</acronym>: Completion of object names now also includes those
starting with &ldquo;.&rdquo;. 
</ul>

   <p>Changes/New Features in 5.2.3:
     <ul>
<li>ESS: When new inferior ESS processes are created, by default they
will replace the current buffer (this restores behavior from pre
5.2.0). If you wish new ESS processes to start in another window of the
current frame, set inferior-ess-same-window to nil. 
<li>New variables inferior-Splus-args and inferior-R-args provide a
way to pass command line arguments to starting S and R processes. 
</ul>

   <p>Changes/New Features in 5.2.2:
     <ul>
<li>bug-fixes for 5.2.1 (require 'executable), html docs, etc. 
<li>ess-lisp-directory/../doc/info added to Info-directory-list
if ess-info not found by info
<li><acronym>ESS[R]</acronym>: If you have other versions of R on your
exec-path, such as "R-1.8.1" with Unix or "rw1081" with Windows,
ESS will find them and create appropriate functions, such as
<kbd>M-x R-1.8.1</kbd> or <kbd>M-x rw1081</kbd>, for calling them. 
By default only Unix programs beginning "R-1" and
"R-2" and Windows programs parallel to the
version of R in your exec-path will be found,
but see ess-r-versions and ess-rterm-versions for ways to find other
versions of R. 
<li><acronym>ESS[R]</acronym>: Other versions of R, such as "R-1.8.1" on Unix and "rw1081" on
Windows, are added to the
"ESS / Start Process / Other" menu. 
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym>: If you have other versions of S-Plus on your Windows computer,
such as S-Plus 6.1 or S-Plus 4.5, ESS will find them and create appropriate
functions, such as <kbd>M-x splus61</kbd>, for calling the console version (Sqpe)
inside an emacs buffer.  By default only
programs installed in the default location will be found, but see
ess-SHOME-versions for ways to find other versions of S-Plus. 
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym>: Other versions of Sqpe on Windows, such as "splus61",
are added to the
"ESS / Start Process / Other" menu. 
<li><acronym>ESS[R]</acronym>: (bug fix) ess-quit (bound to <kbd>C-c C-q</kbd>) should now quit the
inferior R process, when issued from either the inferior buffer, or from
a .R buffer. 
</ul>

   <p>Changes/New Features in 5.2.1:
     <ul>
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym> (R and S-plus): now have toolbar support
with icons to evaluate code in the inferior process or to switch
there.  This code is experimental and likely to change as XEmacs/Emacs
issues get resolved. The toolbar should be enabled if your Emacs
displays images, but can be disabled with the variable ess-use-toolbar. 
Thanks to David Smith from Insightful for the S-plus logo. 
<li><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym>: ess-sas-graph-view (<kbd>F12</kbd>) enhanced; you can specify
external file viewers for each graphics file type via the alist
ess-sas-graph-view-viewer-alist; also .jpg/.gif are now handled
by image-mode on XEmacs, if available, otherwise by graphics
primitives as before
</ul>

   <p>Changes/New Features in 5.2.0:
     <ul>
<li><acronym>ESS[BUGS]</acronym>:  new info documentation!  now supports interactive
processing thanks to <a href="mailto:Aki.Vehtari@hut.fi">Aki Vehtari</a>;
new architecture-independent unix support as well as support for BUGS v. 0.5
<li><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym>:  convert .log to .sas with ess-sas-transcript;
info documentation improved; Local Variable bug fixes;
SAS/IML statements/functions now highlighted; files edited
remotely by ange-ftp/EFS/tramp are recognized and pressing
SUBMIT opens a buffer on the remote host via the local variable
ess-sas-shell-buffer-remote-init which defaults to "ssh";
changed the definition of the variable ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle
to boolean rather than 0/1; added the function ess-electric-run-semicolon
which automatically reverse indents lines containing only "run;";
<kbd>C-F1</kbd> creates MS RTF portrait from the current buffer;
<kbd>C-F2</kbd> creates MS RTF landscape from the current buffer;
<kbd>C-F9</kbd> opens a SAS DATASET with PROC INSIGHT rather than PROC FSVIEW;
"inferior" aliases for SAS batch:  <kbd>C-c C-r</kbd> for submit region,
<kbd>C-c C-b</kbd> for submit buffer, <kbd>C-c C-x</kbd> for goto .log; <kbd>C-c C-y</kbd> for goto .lst
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym>: Pressing underscore ("_") once inserts " &lt;- " (as before);
pressing underscore twice inserts a literal underscore.  To stop this
smart behaviour, add "(ess-smart-underscore nil)" to your .emacs after
ess-site has been loaded;
ess-dump-filename-template-proto (new name!) now can be
customized successfully (for S language dialects);
Support for Imenu has been improved; set ess-imenu-use-S to non-nil to
get an "Imenu-S" item on your menubar;
ess-help: Now using nice underlines (instead of `nuke-* ^H_')
<li><acronym>ESS[R]</acronym>:  After (require 'essa-r), <kbd>M-x ess-r-var</kbd> allows to load
numbers from any Emacs buffer into an existing *R* process;
<kbd>M-x ess-rdired</kbd> gives a &ldquo;directory editor&rdquo; of R objects;
fixed ess-retr-lastvalue-command, i.e. .Last.value bug
(thanks to David Brahm)
<li>ESS: Support for creating new window frames has been added to
ESS.  Inferior ESS processes can be created in dedicated frames by
setting inferior-ess-own-frame to t.  ESS help buffers can also open in
new frames; see the documentation for ess-help-own-frame for details. 
(Thanks to Kevin Rodgers for contributing code.) 
</ul>

   <p>Changes/New Features in 5.1.24:
     <ul>
<li>The version number is now correct even inside ESS/Emacs
</ul>

   <p>Changes/New Features in 5.1.23:
     <ul>
<li>Minor more Makefile clean up. 
</ul>

   <p>Changes/New Features in 5.1.22:
     <ul>
<li>Besides info documentation, PDF and HTML
documentation are also provided (instead of built using "make") and available
on the web as well; see <a href="http://ess.r-project.org/">ESS web page</a> and <a href="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/general/ESS/doc">StatLib</a>
<li>Now that info documentation is available, the
README.* files are no longer supported.  However, they
are still distributed for what it's worth. 
<li>ESS is now an XEmacs package!  See
<a href="http://www.xemacs.org/Install/index.html">XEmacs Installation HOWTO</a>
for details (specifically, items 10-15). 
<li><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym>: more user-friendly enhancements for remote
SAS batch jobs with Kermit file transfers (LOG and OUTPUT
function key features now supported).  Multiple shells
now supported so you can run SAS on different computers
from different buffers by setting the buffer-local variable
ess-sas-shell-buffer to unique buffer names. 
<li>Major re-vamping of Makefile/Makeconf. 
</ul>

   <p>Changes/New Features in 5.1.21:
     <ul>
<li><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym>: info documentation now available!, see
ESS-&gt;Help for SAS; <kbd>F12</kbd> opens GSASFILE nearest point for viewing
either within emacs, when available, or via an external viewer;
more syntax highlighting keywords; more enhancements for remote
SAS batch jobs with Kermit; new framework for remote SAS interactive
jobs, see ess-remote
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym>: info documentation now available!, see
ESS-&gt;Help for the S family
<li>Makefile: tag now independent of rel; info files
made by doc/Makefile and installed in new info sub-directory
</ul>

   <p>Changes/New Features in 5.1.20:
     <ul>
<li>New `options()$STERM' in the S dialects (S, S-Plus, R). 
The S program can determine the environment in which it is
currently running.  ESS sets the option to `iESS' or `ddeESS'
when it starts an S language process.  We recommend other specific
values for S language processes that ESS does not start. 
<li>New `ess-mouse-me' function, assigned to S-mouse-3 by default. 
User may click on a word or region and then choose from the
menu to display the item, or a summary, or a plot, etc. 
This feature is still under development. 
<li>GNU Emacs 21.1 is now supported (fixed for S dialects, SAS &amp; BUGS),
(some from Stephen Eglen). 
<li>XEmacs 21.x is now supported (fixed w32-using-nt bug)
<li>XEmacs on Win (NT) is better supported. 
<li>Workaround for bug in Sqpe+6 (S-PLUS 6 for Win). 
<li>should now work even when imenu is not available (for old XEmacsen). 
<li><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym>: XEmacs-Imenu fix; <kbd>C-TAB</kbd> is globalized along with your
function-key definitions, if specified; you can specify your SAS
library definitions outside of autoexec.sas for ess-sas-data-view
with SAS code placed in the variable ess-sas-data-view-libname,
also the dataset name is defaulted to the nearest permanent dataset
to point; Speedbar support now works for permanent datasets, please
ignore first./last.; new font-locking is now the default with more
improvements for font-locking PROCs, macro statements, * ; and %* ;
comments; you can toggle sas-log-mode with <kbd>F10</kbd> which will font-lock
your .log (if it isn't too big); submit remote .sas files accessed
with ange-ftp, EFS or Tramp (Kermit is experimental) by setting
ess-sas-submit-method to 'sh; ess-sas-submit-command and
ess-sas-submit-command-options are buffer-local so you can have
local file variable sections at the end of your .sas files to
request different executables or specify special options and the
local file variables are re-read at submit instead of only at file
open so that if you make a change it is picked up immediately;
<li><acronym>ESS[BUGS]</acronym>: font-lock with `in' fixed. 
<li>for STATA: font-lock bug fixed. 
<li>for Rd mode: <kbd>C-c C-v</kbd> and `switch-process' in menu. 
further, <kbd>C-c C-f</kbd> prefix (Rd-font) for inserting or surrounding a word
by things such as \code{.}, \code{\link{.}}, \emph{.} etc. 
<li>new functions (ess-directory-function) and (ess-narrow-to-defun)
ess-directory &lt;-&gt; default-directory logic (Jeff Mincy). 
<li>Re-organized Makefile and fixed a few bugs. 
</ul>

   <p>Changes/New Features in 5.1.19:
     <ul>
<li>S+6 now supported (Tony Rossini (Unix) and Rich Heiberger (Windows))
<li>New BUGS support through <acronym>ESS[BUGS]</acronym> mode (Rodney Sparapani)
Templates assist you in writing .bug and .cmd code (.cmd and .log
are replaced by .bmd and .bog to avoid emacs extension collisions). 
Substitution" parameters facilitate "automagic" generation of
data...in" and "init...in" filenames, "const N=" from your data
file and "monitor()/stats()" commands.  Activated by pressing <kbd>F12</kbd>. 
<li>Fixes for `ess-smart-underscore' SAS breakage (Rich Heiberger)
<li>You can change between PC and Unix, local and global SAS function-key
definitions interactively (Rich Heiberger)
<li><kbd>C-Submit</kbd> a highlighted region to SAS batch (Rodney Sparapani)
<li>New and improved SAS syntax highlighting (Rodney Sparapani)
To get the new functionality, set ess-sas-run-make-regexp to nil. 
Also available in .log files via <kbd>F10</kbd>. 
<li>Open a permanent SAS dataset for viewing via <kbd>F9</kbd> (Rodney Sparapani)
You must have the library defined in autoexec.sas for it to work. 
<li>User-friendly defaults for `sas-program', `ess-sas-batch-pre-command'
and `ess-sas-batch-post-command' as well Customize support for these
and other <acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym> variables (Rodney Sparapani)
<li>`ess-sas-suffix-2' now defaults to .dat via <kbd>F11</kbd> (Rodney Sparapani)
<li>Emacs/XEmacs, Unix/Windows issues collectively handled in ess-emcs.el
<li>defadvice solves problem of missing *ESS* (thanks to Jeff Mincy)
<li>Improved manual a bit by including things that were only in `README'. 
</ul>

   <p>Changes/New Features in 5.1.18:
     <ul>
<li>New `ess-smart-underscore' function, now assigned to "_" by default. 
Inserts `ess-S-assign' (customizable " &lt;- "), unless inside string
and comments where plain "_" is used instead. (MM)
<li>Fixes for longstanding interactive SAS breakage (RMH)
</ul>

   <p>Changes/New Features in 5.1.17:
     <ul>
<li>Documentation for Windows Installation (Rich Heiberger)
<li>removal of ess-vars, finalization of customize support (in the
sense that there is no more use of ess-vars, but that we need to
fix ess-cust) (AJ Rossini)
<li>Many small (and large) fixes/contributions (MMaechler)
<li>addition of the "S-equal" variable and provide <kbd>M-x ess-add-MM-keys</kbd>
a way to remap "_" to `ess-S-assign', typically " &lt;- ", but
customizable. (MMaechler)

   <p>Changes/New Features in 5.1.8:
     <ul>
<li>Bug fixes
<li>R documentation mode defaults changed
</ul>

   <p>Changes/New Features in 5.1.2:
     <ul>
<li>able to use inferior iESS mode to
communicate directly with a running S-Plus 4.x process using the
Microsoft DDE protocol.  We use the familiar (from Unix ESS) <kbd>C-c C-n</kbd>
and related key sequences to send lines from the S-mode file to the
inferior S process.  We continue to edit S input files in <acronym>ESS[S]</acronym> mode
and transcripts of previous S sessions in ESS Transcript mode.  All
three modes know the S language, syntax, and indentation patterns and
provide the syntactic highlighting that eases the programming tasks.

<h3 class="section">1.6 Getting the Latest Version</h3>

<p>The latest released version of ESS is always available on the web at:
<a href="http://ess.r-project.org">ESS web page</a> or
<a href="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/general/ESS/">StatLib</a>

<!-- There no longer is an anonymous CVS repository for ESS, due to lack of -->
<!-- interest, little demand, and problems with security. -->
<!-- text below modified from R-admin.texi (thanks to Kurt for the tip). -->
<p>The latest development version of ESS is available via
<a href="https://svn.R-project.org/ESS/">https://svn.R-project.org/ESS/</a>, the ESS Subversion repository.  If
you have a Subversion client (see <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">http://subversion.tigris.org/</a>),
you can download the sources using:
<pre class="smallexample">     % svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/ESS/trunk <var>path</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which will put the ESS files into directory <var>path</var>.  Later,
within that directory, `svn update' will bring that directory up to
date.  Windows-based tools such as TortoiseSVN are also available for
downloading the files.  Alternatively, you can browse the sources with a
web browser at: <a href="https://svn.r-project.org/ESS/trunk">ESS SVN site</a>.  However, please use a subversion client instead to minimize the
load when retrieving.

   <p>If you remove other versions of ESS from your emacs load-path, you can
then use the development version by adding the following to .emacs:

<pre class="example">     (load "/path/to/ess-svn/lisp/ess-site.el")
</pre>
   <p>Note that https is required, and that the SSL certificate for the
Subversion server of the R project is

<pre class="smallexample">     Certificate information:
      - Hostname: svn.r-project.org
      - Valid: from Jul 16 08:10:01 2004 GMT until Jul 14 08:10:01 2014 GMT

<h3 class="section">1.8 Unix installation</h3>

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>cd to a directory where you want to install ESS, creating it if necessary. 
This directory will be referred to below as ESSDIR. 
<!-- It will contain, -->
<!-- at the end, the tar file @file{ess-VERSION.tar.gz}, and a directory for -->
<!-- the ESS source, which will be termed "the ESS-VERSION source directory". -->
<!-- Note that the .elc files may be installed elsewhere (as specified in the -->
<!-- Makefile) if desired. -->

     <li>Retrieve the latest version from
<a href="http://ess.r-project.org/downloads/ess">ESS downloads area</a>
to ESSDIR.

     <li>Decompress/unarchive the files from the disribution.
     <pre class="example">          gunzip ess-VERSION.tar.gz
          tar xvf ess-VERSION.tar
     </pre>
     <pre class="display">          (or: <code>gunzip &lt; ess-VERSION.tar.gz | tar xvf -</code> ).
          (or using GNU tar:  <code>tar zxvf ess-VERSION.tar.gz</code>).
     </pre>
     <p>The <code>tar</code> command will create the subdirectory ess-VERSION and unarchive
the files there.

     <!-- If you are using GNU Emacs 19.29, decompress/unarchive -->
<!-- @file{ESSDIR/ess-VERSION/lisp/19.29.tar.gz}, -->
<!-- read @file{ESSDIR/ess-VERSION/lisp/19.29/README}, follow the instructions -->
<!-- and you might be able to get ESS to work. -->
<!-- @emph{Please note that GNU Emacs 19.29 is no longer supported}. -->
<!-- For a list of supported versions of emacs, see @xref{Requirements}. -->
<li>Edit the file <span class="file">ESSDIR/ess-VERSION/lisp/ess-site.el</span> as explained in the
comments section of that file. 
<!-- Installations that are using ESS only for S-Plus -->
<!-- 6.x will probably not need to make any changes.  Installations that also -->
<!-- have one or more of (S4, S+3/4/5/6/7, R, SAS, BUGS, XLispStat, Stata) -->
<!-- may need to uncomment corresponding lines in @file{ESSDIR/ess-VERSION/lisp/ess-site.el}. -->

     <li> Add the line
     <pre class="example">          (load "ESSDIR/ess-VERSION/lisp/ess-site")
     </pre>
     <p>to your user or system installation file
(GNU Emacs uses <span class="file">$HOME/.emacs</span> and XEmacs uses <span class="file">$HOME/.xemacs/init.el</span>
for the user initialization file.  GNU Emacs uses default.el or site-init.el and
XEmacs uses site-start.el for the system installation file).

     <p>Alternatively, if ess-site.el is in your current Lisp path, you can do:
     <pre class="example">          (require 'ess-site)
     </pre>
     <p>to configure emacs for ESS.

     <li>That's it!  If you are installing just a local copy of ESS for yourself,
ESS is now ready to be used.  (The remaining step below is for
advanced installation.)  To edit statistical programs, load the files
with the requiste extensions (".sas" for SAS, ".S" for S-PLUS, ".R" for
R, and ".lsp" for XLispStat).  To start a statistical process within
Emacs, such as R, type <code>M-x R</code>.

     <!-- @item -->
<!-- (OPTIONAL) If you are running S-PLUS or R, you might consider -->
<!-- installing the database files.  From within emacs, @code{C-x d} to the -->
<!-- directory containing ESS.  Now: -->
<!-- @example -->
<!-- M-x S+6 -->
<!-- @end example -->
<!-- to get S running.  Once you see the SPLUS prompt, do: -->
<!-- @example -->
<!-- M-x ess-create-object-name-db -->
<!-- @end example -->
<!-- (this will create the file @file{ess-sp6-namedb.el}; if it isn't in the -->
<!-- ESS directory, move it there). -->
<!-- Then, completions will be autoloaded and will not be regenerated for -->
<!-- every session. -->
<!-- For R, do the same, using -->
<!-- @example -->
<!-- M-x R -->
<!-- @end example -->
<!-- and then @code{M-x ess-create-object-name-db} creating -->
<!-- @file{ess-r-namedb.el}; if it isn't in the ESS directory, move it there). -->
<li><b>(OPTIONAL) READ THIS ITEM THOROUGHLY BEFORE STARTING</b>:

     <p>If you want to place the compiled files in other locations edit the LISPDIR and INFODIR
entries in <span class="file">Makeconf</span> in the ESSDIR/ess-VERSION directory (if you are using XEmacs,
then you also need to edit the EMACS entry as follows:  EMACS=xemacs).

     <p>You can compile those files by:
     <pre class="example">          make all
     </pre>
     <p>When that completes successfully, install the compiled files:
     <pre class="example">          make install
     </pre>
     <p>This will install the compiled info files and lisp files.  If you are an
XEmacs user, then you should be done.  If not, then you may have to
edit/create the file <span class="file">dir</span> that is found in the directory specified
by <code>INFODIR</code>: see the sample <span class="file">dir</span> in ESSDIR/ess-VERSION/doc/info. 
If <span class="file">dir</span> does not exist in <code>INFODIR</code>, then the sample
<span class="file">dir</span> will be installed.

     <p><em>Note:</em> ESS can be installed for XEmacs as an XEmacs package
much more easily than what has been described anywhere above.  However,
the latest ESS version will not be available at the same time as an
XEmacs package; generally, it can take weeks or months to appear in the
latter format.  For more information on installing ESS as an XEmacs
package see <a href="http://www.xemacs.org/Documentation/packageGuide.html">Quickstart Package Guide</a>.

     <!-- An alternative, if you are running XEmacs and have access to the -->
<!-- XEmacs system directories, would be to place the directory in the -->
<!-- site-lisp directory, and simply type @code{make all} (and copy the -->
<!-- documentation as appropriate). -->
<!-- For GNU Emacs, you would still have to move the files into the top level -->
<!-- site-lisp directory. -->

<h3 class="section">1.9 Microsoft Windows installation</h3>

<p>For <b>Microsoft Windows installation</b>, please follow the next steps:
(see separate instructions above for UNIX See <a href="#Unix-installation">Unix installation</a>.

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>cd to a directory where you keep emacs lisp files, or create a new
directory (for example, <span class="file">c:\emacs\</span>) to hold the distribution.  This
directory will be referred to below as "the ESS distribution
directory".  It will contain, at the end, either the tar file
<span class="file">ess-VERSION.tar.gz</span> or the zip file <span class="file">ess-VERSION.zip</span>, and a
directory
for the ESS source, which will be termed "the ESS-VERSION source
directory".

     <li>Retrieve the compressed tar file <span class="file">ess-VERSION.tar.gz</span> or the
zipped file <span class="file">ess-VERSION.zip</span> from one of the FTP or WWW
archive sites
via FTP (or HTTP).  Be aware that http browsers on Windows
frequently change the "." and "-" characters in filenames to other
punctuation.  Please change the names back to their original form.

     <li>Copy <span class="file">ess-VERSION.tar.gz</span> to the location where you want the
ess-VERSION directory, for example to
<span class="file">c:\emacs\ess-VERSION.tar.gz</span>, and cd there.  For example,

     <pre class="example">          cd c:\emacs
     </pre>
     <p>Extract the files from the distribution, which will unpack
into a subdirectory, <span class="file">ess-VERSION</span>.
     <pre class="example">          gunzip ess-VERSION.tar.gz
          tar xvf ess-VERSION.tar
          (or: <code>gunzip &lt; ess-VERSION.tar.gz | tar xvf -</code> ).
          (or: from the zip file: <code>unzip ess-VERSION.zip</code>)
     </pre>
     <p>The <code>tar</code> command will extract files into the current directory.

     <p>Do not create <span class="file">ess-VERSION</span> yourself, or you will get an extra level
of depth to your directory structure.

     <li>Windows users will usually be able to use the `lisp/ess-site.el'
as distributed.  Only rarely will changes be needed.

     <li>Windows users will need to make sure that the directories for the
software they will be using is in the PATH environment variable.  On
Windows 9x, add lines similar to the following to your
<span class="file">c:\autoexec.bat</span>
file:
     <pre class="example">          path=%PATH%;c:\progra~1\spls2000\cmd
     </pre>
     <p>On Windows NT/2000/XP, add the directories to the PATH using the
<code>My Computer/Control Panel/System/Advanced/Environment Variables</code> menu. 
Note that the directory containing the program is
added to the PATH, not the program itself.  One such line is needed
for each software program.  Be sure to use the abbreviation
<code>progra~1</code> and not the long version with embedded blanks.  Use
backslashes "\".

     <li>Add the line
     <pre class="example">          (load "/PATH/ess-site")
     </pre>
     <p>to your .emacs (or _emacs) file (or default.el or site-init.el, for
a site-wide installation).  Replace <code>/PATH</code> above with the
value of ess-lisp-directory as defined in <span class="file">ess-site.el</span>.  Use
forwardslashes <code>/</code>. 
(GNU Emacs uses the filename <span class="file">%HOME%/.emacs</span> and
XEmacs uses the filename <span class="file">%HOME%/.xemacs/init.el</span>
for the initialization file.)

     <li>To edit statistical programs, load the files with the requisite
extensions  (".sas" for SAS, ".S" or "s" or "q" or "Q" for S-PLUS,
".r" or ".R" for R, and ".lsp"   for XLispStat).

     <li>To run statistical processes under emacs:

     <p>To start the S-PLUS [67].x GUI from ESS under emacs:
     <pre class="example">          M-x S
          (or <code>M-x S+6</code>).
     </pre>
     <p>You will then be
asked for a pathname ("S starting data directory?"), from which to
start the process.  The prompt will propose your current directory
as the default.  ESS will start the S-PLUS GUI.  There will be
slight delay during which emacs is temporarily frozen.  ESS will arrange for
communication with the S-PLUS GUI using the DDE protocol. 
Send lines or regions
from the emacs buffer containing your S program (for example,
<span class="file">myfile.s</span>) to the S-PLUS Commands Window with the
<code>C-c C-n</code> or <code>C-c C-r</code> keys. 
(If you are still using S-PLUS 4.x or 2000, then use <code>M-x S+4</code>.)

     <p>To start an S-PLUS [67].x session inside an emacs buffer&mdash;and
without the S-PLUS GUI:
     <pre class="example">          M-x Sqpe
          (or <code>M-x Sqpe+6</code>).
     </pre>
     <p>You will then be asked for a pathname ("S starting data
directory?"), from which to start the process.  The prompt will
propose your current directory as the default. 
You get Unix-like behavior, in particular the entire
transcript is available for emacs-style search commands. 
Send lines or regions from the emacs buffer containing your S
program (for example, <span class="file">myfile.s</span>) to the *S+6* buffer with the
<code>C-c C-n</code> or <code>C-c C-r</code> keys. 
Interactive graphics are available with Sqpe by using the java
library supplied with S-PLUS 6.1 and newer releases. 
Enter the commands:
     <pre class="example">          library(winjava)
          java.graph()
     </pre>
     <p>Graphs can be saved from the <code>java.graph</code> device
in several formats, but not PostScript.   If you
need a PostScript file you will need to open a separate
<code>postscript</code> device. 
(If you are still using S-PLUS 4.x or 2000, then use <code>M-x Sqpe+4</code>.)

     <p>To connect to an already running S-PLUS GUI (started, for example,
from the S-PLUS icon):
     <pre class="example">          M-x S+6-existing
     </pre>
     <p>You will then be
asked for a pathname ("S starting data directory?"), from which to
start the process.  The prompt will propose your current directory
as the default.  ESS will arrange for
communication with the already running S-PLUS GUI using the DDE protocol. 
Send lines or regions
from the emacs buffer containing your S program (for example,
<span class="file">myfile.s</span>) to the S-PLUS Commands Window with the
<code>C-c C-n</code> or <code>C-c C-r</code> keys. 
(If you are still using S-PLUS 4.x or 2000, then use <code>M-x S+4-existing</code>.)

     <p>If you wish to run R, you can start it with:
     <pre class="example">          M-x R
     </pre>
     <p>XLispStat can not currently be run with
     <pre class="example">          M-x XLS
     </pre>
     <p>Hopefully, this will change.  However, you can still edit with
emacs, and cut and paste the results into the XLispStat
*Listener* Window under Microsoft Windows.

<h3 class="section">1.10 Reporting Bugs</h3>

<p>Please send bug reports, suggestions etc. to

   <p>&lt;A HREF="mailto:ESS-bugs@stat.math.ethz.ch"&gt;
<a href="mailto:ESS-bugs@stat.math.ethz.ch">ESS-bugs@stat.math.ethz.ch</a>
&lt;/A&gt;

   <p>The easiest way to do this is within Emacs by typing

   <p><kbd>M-x ess-submit-bug-report</kbd>

   <p>This also gives the maintainers valuable information about your
installation which may help us to identify or even fix the bug.

   <p>If Emacs reports an error, backtraces can help us debug the problem. 
Type "M-x set-variable RET debug-on-error RET t RET".  Then run the
command that causes the error and you should see a *Backtrace* buffer
containing debug information; send us that buffer.

   <p>Note that comments, suggestions, words of praise and large cash
donations are also more than welcome.

<h3 class="section">1.11 Mailing Lists</h3>

<p>There is a mailing list for discussions and announcements relating to
ESS.  Join the list by sending an e-mail with "subscribe ess-help" (or
"help") in the body to <a href="mailto:ess-help-request@stat.math.ethz.ch">ess-help-request@stat.math.ethz.ch</a>;
contributions to the list may be mailed to
<a href="mailto:ess-help@stat.math.ethz.ch">ess-help@stat.math.ethz.ch</a>.  Rest assured, this is a fairly
low-volume mailing list.

   <p>The purposes of the mailing list include

     <ul>
<li> helping users of ESS to get along with it. 
<li> discussing aspects of using ESS on Emacs and XEmacs. 
<li> suggestions for improvements. 
<li> announcements of new releases of ESS. 
<li> posting small patches to ESS. 
</ul>
