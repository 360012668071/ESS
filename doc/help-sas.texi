ESS[SAS] was designed for use with SAS.  It is descended from emacs 
macros developed by John Sall for editing SAS programs and SAS-mode by 
Tom Cook.  Those editing features and new advanced features are part of 
ESS[SAS].  The user interface of ESS[SAS] has similarities with ESS[S]
and the SAS Display Manager.  By emacs, we mean either GNU Emacs from 
the Free Software Foundation or XEmacs from the XEmacs Project.

@section ESS[SAS]--Design philosophy

ESS[SAS] was designed to aid the user in writing and maintaining
SAS programs, such as myfile.sas.  Both interactive and batch submission
of SAS programs is supported.   

ESS[SAS] was written with two primary goals.

1. Using the emacs environment is desirable for users accessing a remote
computer via a network or dial-up who can not use the SAS Display Manager.

2. Using the emacs environment is desirable for local users as well due to the
inherent efficiency of using the same, superior interface all of the time.

@section ESS[SAS]--Editing files

ESS[SAS] is the mode for editing SAS language files.  This mode handles:

@display
- proper indenting, generated by both [Tab] and [Return].
- color and font choices based on syntax.
- ability to send the contents of an entire buffer, a highlighted region,
  or a single line to an interactive SAS process.
- ability to switch between processes which would be the target of the
  buffer (for the above).
- ability to save and submit the file you are working on as a batch SAS
  process with a single keypress and to continue editing while it is runs
  in the background.
- capability of killing the batch SAS process through the shell buffer or
  allow the SAS process to keep on running after you exit emacs.
- single keypress navigation of .sas, .log and .lst files (.log and .lst
  files are automatically refreshed with each keypress).
@end display

ESS[SAS] is automatically turned on when editing a file with a ".sas" 
suffix (or other, if specified in ess-site).  The batch processing keypress 
commands are enabled by default to use the same function keys that the 
SAS Display Manager does.  The interactive capabilities of ESS require you to
start an inferior SAS process with M-x SAS
(@xref{iESS(SAS)--Interactive SAS processes}.)

At this writing (@essver{}), the indenting and syntactic
highlighting are generally correct.

@section iESS[SAS]--Interactive SAS processes

iESS (inferior ESS) is the mode for interfacing with interactive
statistical processes (programs).  iESS[SAS] is what is needed for
interactive SAS programming.  iESS[SAS] works best
with the following settings for SAS command-line options.  
The default of inferior-SAS-args in essd-sas.el is

@example
-stdio -linesize 80 -noovp -nosyntaxcheck
@end example

with the interpretations:
@display
-stdio          required to make the redirection of stdio work
-linesize 80    keeps output lines from folding on standard terminals
-noovp          prevents error messages from printing 3 times
-nosyntaxcheck  permits recovery after syntax errors
@end display

To start up iESS[SAS] mode, use:
@example
   M-x SAS
@end example

The *SAS:1.log* buffer in ESStr mode corresponds to the file
myfile.log in SAS batch usage and to the "SAS: LOG" window in the SAS
window environment.  All commands submitted to SAS, informative
messages, warnings, and errors appear here.

The *SAS:1.lst* buffer in ESSlst mode corresponds to the file
myfile.lst in SAS batch usage and to the "SAS: OUTPUT" window in the
SAS window environment.  All data related printed output from the
PROCs appear in this window.

The iESS [SAS:1] buffer exists solely as a communications buffer.
Files are edited in the myfile.sas buffer.  The C-c C-r key in
ESS[SAS] is the functional equivalent of bringing a file into the
"SAS: PROGRAM EDITOR" window followed by the 'Local' 'Submit' menu
commands.  The user should never use this buffer directly.

We plan to add
@display
- The ability to request help from a process for variables and
  functions, and to have the results sent into a separate buffer.
- completion of object names and file names.
@end display

@section ESS[SAS]--Batch SAS processes

Submission of a SAS batch job is dependent on your environment.  
ess-sas-submit-method is determined by your operating system and your shell.
It defaults to 'sh unless you are running Windows or Mac Classic.  Under Windows,
it will default to 'sh if you are using bash for your shell rather than
MS-DOS ('ms-dos).  On Mac OS X, it will default to 'sh, but under Mac Classic 
AppleScript is used ('apple-script).  You will also set this to 'sh if the SAS batch 
job needs to run on a remote machine rather than your local machine.  This works
transparently if you are editing the remote file via ange-ftp/EFS or tramp.  
However, if you are editing the file locally and transferring it back and forth
with Kermit, you need some additional steps.  First of all, start Kermit locally
before remotely logging in.  Execute the command ess-kermit-get.  A local copy
of the file will be created with the ess-kermit-prefix character prepended (the
default is "#").  Also, note that the remote Kermit command is defined by
ess-kermit-command.  

The command used by the SUBMIT function key (F3 or F8) to submit a batch SAS 
job, whether local or remote, is ess-sas-submit-command which defaults to sas-program.  sas-program is 
"invoke SAS using program file" for Mac Classic and "sas" otherwise.  However, 
you may have to alter ess-sas-submit-command for a particular program, so it is 
defined as buffer-local (conveniently, you can set it in Local Variables: at 
the end of your program).  The command line is also made of 
ess-sas-submit-pre-command, ess-sas-submit-post-command and 
ess-sas-submit-command-options (the last of which is also buffer-local).
Here are some examples for your .emacs file (you may also use 
M-x customize-variable with):
@example
(setq ess-sas-submit-pre-command "nohup")                 ;'sh default
(setq ess-sas-submit-post-command "-rsasuser &")          ;'sh default
(setq ess-sas-submit-command "/usr/local/sas/sas")        ;'sh example
(setq ess-sas-submit-pre-command "start")                 ;'ms-dos default
(setq ess-sas-submit-post-command "-rsasuser -icon")      ;'ms-dos default
(setq ess-sas-submit-command "c:/progra~1/sas/sas.exe")   ;Windows example
(setq ess-sas-submit-command "c:\\progra~1\\sas\\sas.exe");Windows example
@end example

There is a built-in delay before a batch SAS job is submitted when using
a Unix shell under Windows.  This is necessary in many cases 
since the shell might not be ready to receive a command.  This delay is 
currently set high enough so as not to be a problem.  But,
there may be cases when it needs to be set higher, or could be set much
lower to speed things up.  You can over-ride the default in your .emacs
file by:
@example
(setq ess-sleep-for 0.2)
@end example

@section ESS[SAS]--Function keys for batch processing

The description of the setup for function keys for batch processing of
SAS files is unavoidably complex.  The actual
usage of the function keys is simple.  There are five distinct options:

1. (default) Function keys in ESS[SAS] modes do whatever they normally
do in other emacs modes.  Many users will have defined some of the
keys [f2]-[f12] in their .emacs or _emacs file, or will have
installation-wide definitions in their site-start.el file.  By
default, ESS does not override those definitions.  This default is
intended to make ESS[SAS] mode behave similarly to other emacs modes.

2,3,4,5.
Users who are primarily familiar with SAS, and who are learning emacs
as a way to approach SAS, will likely want to duplicate the function
key capabilities of the SAS Display Manager.  There are still options.

@enumerate
@item
SAS provides different function key
definitions with its PC and Unix products; ESS can use either.
@item
The ESS[SAS] function key definitions can be active in all buffers
(global) or limited (local) only to buffers that have SAS-related file
extensions: .sas, .log, .lst, filetype-1 (which defaults to .txt),
and filetype-2 which defaults to .dat.
@end enumerate

The distinction between local and global appears subtle.  If you want
the ESS[SAS] definitions to work when you are in the *shell* buffer or when
editing files other than the file extensions that SAS recognizes, you
will most likely want to use the global definitions.
If you want your function keys to understand SAS batch commands when you
are editing SAS files, and to behave normally when editing other files,
then you will choose the local definitions.  The option can be chosen by 
the person installing ESS for a site or by an individual.

@enumerate
@item
For a site installation or an individual, uncomment only one of the 
following lines in your ess-site.el!
ESS[SAS] Function keys are available in ESS[SAS] and related modes if you
uncomment either 2 or 3 and in all modes if you uncomment 4 or 5:
@example
;;2; (setq ess-sas-local-unix-keys t)
;;3; (setq ess-sas-local-pc-keys t)
;;4; (setq ess-sas-global-unix-keys t)
;;5; (setq ess-sas-global-pc-keys t)
@end example

The names -unix- and -pc- have nothing to do with the operating system
that you are running.  Rather, they mimic the definitions that the SAS
Display Manager uses by default on those platforms.

@item
If your site installation has configured the keys contrary to your 
liking, say 2, you must turn it off before selecting a different 
option, say 3.  
@example 
 (load "ess-site")
 (setq ess-sas-local-unix-keys nil) ;;2
 (setq ess-sas-local-pc-keys t)     ;;3
@end example
@end enumerate

Finally, we get to what the function keys actually do.  You may recognize
some of the Short Names as SAS Display Manager commands (they
are in all capitals).

@display

                        in emacs or with an external viewer
@end display

Besides the keys that mimic SAS Display Manager commands, six other keys
have been provided for convenience.

`shell' switches you to the *shell* buffer where you can interact with
your operating system.  This is especially helpful if you would like to 
kill a SAS batch job.  You can specify a different buffer name to 
associate with a SAS batch job (besides *shell*) with the buffer-local 
variable ess-sas-shell-buffer.  This allows you to have multiple 
buffers running SAS batch jobs that may be on different local/remote
computers.

F2 performs the `refresh' operation on the current buffer.  `refresh' 
compares the buffer date/time stamp with the file date/time stamp and 
replaces the buffer with the file if the file is newer.  This is the same 
operation that is automatically performed when LOG, OUTPUT, `filetype-1' 
or `filetype-2' are pressed.

`filetype-1' switches you to a file with the same file root as your .sas file, 
but with a different extension; .txt by default.  
You can over-ride the default, by specifying a different extension 
in your .emacs file.  
@example
(setq ess-sas-suffix-1 "txt")
@end example

`filetype-2' is similar, except it is .dat by default.  

F9 will prompt you for the name of a permanent SAS dataset near point to be opened
for viewing by PROC FSEDIT.  You can control the SAS batch command-line with
ess-sas-data-view-submit-options.  For controlling the SAS batch commands, you have 
the global variables ess-sas-data-view-libname and ess-sas-data-view-fsview-command 
as well as the buffer-local variable ess-sas-data-view-fsview-statement.  If
you have your SAS LIBNAMEs defined in autoexec.sas, then the defaults for
these variables should be sufficient.

F10 toggles ESS[SAS] mode for .log files which is off by default (technically, 
it is SAS-log-mode, but it looks the same).  The syntax highlighting can be 
helpful in certain debugging situations, but large .log files may take a long 
time to highlight.  

F12 will prompt you for the name of a GSASFILE near point to be opened for viewing either with
emacs or with an external viewer.  Depending on your version of emacs and
the operating system you are using, emacs may support .gif and .jpg files
internally.  You may need to change the following two variables for your
own situation:
@example
(setq ess-sas-graph-suffix-regexp "[.]\\(e?ps\\|gif\\|jpe?g\\|tiff?\\)")
(setq ess-sas-image-viewer "kodakimg") ;; external viewer
@end example

@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@node  ESS(SAS)--TAB key, ESS(SAS)--Usage scenarios, ESS(SAS)--Function keys for batch processing, Help for SAS
@section ESS[SAS]--TAB key

Two options.  The TAB key is bound by default to sas-indent-line.  This function is
used to syntactically indent SAS code so PROC and RUN are in the left
margin, other statements are indented 4 spaces from the margin,
continuation lines are indented 4 spaces in from the beginning column
of that statement.  This is the type of functionality that emacs
provides in most programming language modes.  This functionality is
equivalent to uncommenting the following line in ess-site.el:
@example
;;; (setq ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle 0)
@end example

ESS provides an alternate behavior for the TAB key that makes it
behave as it does on non-emacs terminals, i.e. move the cursor to the
next tab stop.  The alternate behavior also provides a backwards TAB
key: C-TAB.  This functionality is obtained by uncommenting the
following line in ess-site.el:
@example
;;; (setq ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle 1)
@end example
Under the alternate behavior, the TAB key is bound to tab-to-tab-stop
and the tab stops are set by default at multiples of 4.

@section ESS[SAS]--Usage scenarios

We present one scenario for using ESS to interact with SAS.
Contributions of examples of how you work with ESS are appreciated
(especially since it helps us determine priorities on future
enhancements)! (comments as to what should be happening are prefixed
by "##").

Batch SAS (-unix-keys illustrated, pc-keys in the comments)
@example
    ## Find the file you want to work with
    C-x C-f myfile.sas
    ## myfile.sas will be in ESS[SAS] mode

    ## Edit as appropriate, then save and submit the batch SAS job.
    ## -pc- F8
    F3

    ## The job runs in the shell buffer while you continue to edit 
    ## myfile.sas.  If you are running a Unix shell under Unix or
    ## Windows, the message buffer will notify you with a shell
    ## notification when the job is complete.  If so, then you 
    ## will also have the option of terminating the batch job
    ## before it is finished.
    ## -pc- F3
    F8

    ## In any case, you may want to visit the .log while the process
    ## is still running (unix only) or when it is done and check for
    ## error messages 
    ## (you will be taken to the next error message, if any).
    ## The .log will be refreshed and you will be placed in it's buffer.
    ## -pc- F6
    F5

    ## Now, refresh the .lst and go to it's buffer.
    ## -pc- F7
    F6

    ## If you wish to make changes, go to the .sas file with
    ## -pc- F5
    F4
    ## make your editing changes and then submit again.
@end example

Interactive SAS
@example
    ## Find the file you want to work with
    C-x C-f myfile.sas
    ## myfile.sas will be in ESS[SAS] mode

    ## Edit as appropriate, and then start up SAS with the cursor in
    ## the myfile.sas buffer
    M-x SAS

    ## Four buffers will appear on screen:
    ## myfile.sas  in  ESS[SAS]        mode # your source file
    ## *SAS:1*     in  iESS [SAS:1]    mode # ESS communication buffer
    ## *SAS:1.log* in  Shell [] ESStr  mode # SAS log information
    ## *SAS:1.lst* in  Shell [] ESSlst mode # SAS listing information

    ## If you would prefer each of the four buffers to appear in its
    ## own individual frame, you can arrange for that.  Place the
    ## cursor in the buffer displaying myfile.sas.  Enter the
    ## sequence:
    C-c C-w

    ## The cursor will normally be in buffer myfile.sas.
    ## If not, put it there:
    C-x b myfile.sas

    ## Send regions, lines, or the entire file contents to SAS
    ## (regions are most useful).  A highlighted region will normally
    ## begin with the keywords 'DATA' or 'PROC' and end with the
    ## keyword 'RUN;'
    C-c C-r

    ## Information appears in the log buffer, analysis results in the
    ## listing buffer.  In case of errors, make the corrections in the
    ## myfile.sas buffer and resubmit with another C-c C-r

    ## PROC GPLOT graphs will normally be produced in a postscript
    ## file and be viewed later.  Include the lines
    /* required gsoptions for batch files */
    /* comment out these lines for interactive use on X-terminals*/
    filename grafout 'temp.ps';
    goptions device=ps gsfname=grafout gsfmode=append gaccess=sasgastd;
    ## in myfile.sas.

    ## PROC PLOT graphs can be viewed in the listing buffer.  You may
    ## wish to control the vertical spacing to allow the entire plot
    ## to be visible on screen, for example, by
    proc plot; plot a*b / vpos=25;

    ## At the end of the session you may save the log and listing
    ## buffers with the usual C-x C-s commands.  You will be prompted
    ## for a file name.  Typically, the names myfile.log and mfile.lst
    ## will be used.  You will almost certainly want to edit the saved
    ## files before including them in a report.  The files are
    ## read-only by default.  You can make them writable by the emacs
    ## command C-x C-q.

    ## At the end of the session, the input file myfile.sas will
    ## typically have been revised.  You can save it.  It can be used
    ## later as the beginning of another iESS[SAS] session.  It can
    ## also be used as a batch input file to SAS.

    ## The *SAS:1* buffer is strictly for ESS use.  The user should
    ## never need to read it or write to it.  Refer to the .lst and
    ## .log buffers for monitoring output!
@end example

Here is a typical myfile.sas:
@example
    title 'Analysis of Case 0502';

    data case0502;
        infile '/home/public/stat/Data/case0502.asc'
               firstobs=2;
        input percent code;
    run;

    proc glm;
      class code;
      model percent=code /ss1;
    run;

@section ESS[SAS]--Common problems

@display
1. MS Windows users.
   - M-x SAS does not work on MS Windows.  In order to run SAS inside
   an Emacs buffer it is necessary to start SAS with the -stdio option.
   SAS does not support the -stdio option on Windows.

2. If M-x SAS gives weird errors upon startup, check the following:
   - you are running Windows:  SAS does not support stdio on Windows
   - ess-sas-sh-command (in the ESS source directory) needs to be
     executable (solution: "chmod ugo+rx ess-sas-sh-command").
   - sas isn't in your executable path (verify using "which sas" from
     a shell command-line)
   - you need a copy of SAS (we can't solve this)

3. M-x SAS starts up SAS in the window system (motif, for example),
   instead of starting it up in the emacs buffers.

   Probably the unix command "sas" on your system calls a local
   script which in turn calls the sas executable.  The fix is to
   call the sas executable directly.

   Change the line in ess-sas-sh command from:
   @example
sas </dev/tty 1>$stdout 2>$stderr $@
   @end example
   to a call to the complete path name of the sas executable on
   your system, for example:
   @example
/usr/local/sas612/sas </dev/tty 1>$stdout 2>$stderr $@
   @end example
   To find the complete path name on your system, you can
   execute the line (from the unix prompt):
   @example
find / -name 'sas' -exec ls -ld @{@} \;
   @end example
   and expect a response similar to the following
   @example
-rwxr-xr-x   1 sas  sas  2441216 Sep  9  1997 /usr/local/sas612/sas
   @end example
