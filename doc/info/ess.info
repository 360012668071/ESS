     Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) provides an intelligent, consistent
     interface between the user and the software.  ESS interfaces with
     SAS, S-PLUS, R, BUGS and other statistical analysis packages under
     the Unix, Microsoft Windows, and Apple Mac operating systems.  ESS
     is itself a package within the emacs text editor and uses emacs
     features to streamline the creation and use of statistical
     software.  ESS knows the syntax and grammar of statistical
     analysis packages and provides consistent display and editing
     features based on that knowledge.  ESS assists in interactive and
     batch execution of statements written in these statistical
     analysis languages.

1 Introduction to ESS
*********************

The S family (S, Splus and R) and SAS statistical analysis packages
provide sophisticated statistical and graphical routines for
manipulating data.   Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) is based on the
merger of two pre-cursors, S-mode and SAS-mode, which provided support
for the S family and SAS respectively.  Later on, Stata-mode was also
incorporated.

   ESS provides a common, generic, and useful interface, through emacs,
to many statistical packages.  It currently supports the S family, SAS,
BUGS, Stata and XLisp-Stat with the level of support roughly in that
order.

   A bit of notation before we begin.  _emacs_ refers to both _GNU
Emacs_ by the Free Software Foundation, as well as _XEmacs_ by the
XEmacs Project.  The emacs major mode `ESS[language]', where `language'
can take values such as `S', `SAS', or `XLS'.  The inferior process
interface (the connection between emacs and the running process)
referred to as inferior ESS (`iESS'), is denoted in the modeline by
`ESS[dialect]', where `dialect' can take values such as `S3', `S4',
`S+3', `S+4', `S+5', `S+6', `R', `XLS', `VST', `SAS'.

   Currently, the documentation contains many references to ``S'' where
actually any supported (statistics) language is meant, i.e., `S' could
also mean `XLisp-Stat' or `SAS'.

   For exclusively interactive users of S, ESS provides a number of
features to make life easier.  There is an easy to use command history
mechanism, including a quick prefix-search history.  To reduce typing,
command-line completion is provided for all S objects and "hot keys"
are provided for common S function calls.  Help files are easily
accessible, and a paging mechanism is provided to view them.  Finally,
an incidental (but very useful) side-effect of ESS is that a transcript
of your session is kept for later saving or editing.

   No special knowledge of Emacs is necessary when using S
interactively under ESS.

   For those that use S in the typical edit-test-revise cycle when
programming S functions, ESS provides for editing of S functions in
Emacs edit buffers.  Unlike the typical use of S where the editor is
restarted every time an object is edited, ESS uses the current Emacs
session for editing.  In practical terms, this means that you can edit
more than one function at once, and that the ESS process is still
available for use while editing.  Error checking is performed on
functions loaded back into S, and a mechanism to jump directly to the
error is provided.  ESS also provides for maintaining text versions of
your S functions in specified source directories.

1.1 Why should I use ESS?
=========================

Statistical packages are powerful software systems for manipulating and
analyzing data, but their user interfaces often leave something
something to be desired:  they offer weak editor functionality and they
differ among themselves so markedly that you have to re-learn how to do
those things for each package.  ESS is a package which is designed to
make editing and interacting with statistical packages more uniform,
user-friendly and give you the power of emacs as well.

   ESS provides several features which make it easier to interact with
the ESS process (a connection between your buffer and the statistical
package which is waiting for you to input commands).  These include:

   * Command-line editing for fixing mistakes in commands before they
     are entered.  The `-e' flag for S-plus provides something similar
     to this, but here you have the full range of Emacs commands rather
     than a limited subset.  However, other packages such as XLisp-Stat
     and S3 do not necessarily have features like this built-in.  *Note
     Command-line editing::.

   * Searchable command history for recalling previously-submitted
     commands.  This provides all the features of the `Splus -e' history
     mechanism, plus added features such as history searching.  *Note
     Command History::.

   * Command-line completion of both object and file names for quick
     entry.  This is similar to `tcsh''s facility for filenames; here it
     also applies to object names and list components.  *Note
     Completion::.

   * Hot-keys for quick entry of commonly-used commands in `S' such as
     `objects()' and `search()'.  *Note Hot keys::.

   * Transcript recording for a complete record of all the actions in an
     S session.  *Note Transcript::.

   * Interface to the help system, with a specialized mode for viewing S
     help files.  *Note Help::.


   If you commonly create or modify S functions, you will have found
the standard facilities for this (the `fix()' function, for example)
severely limiting.  Using S's standard features, one can only edit one
function at a time, and you can't continue to use S while editing.  ESS
corrects these problems by introducing the following features:

   * Object editing.  ESS allows you to edit more than one function
     simultaneously in dedicated Emacs buffers.  The ESS process may
     continue to be used while functions are being edited.  *Note Edit
     buffer::.

   * A specialized editing mode for S code, which provides syntactic
     indentation and highlighting.  *Note Indenting::.

   * Facilities for loading and error-checking source files, including a
     keystroke to jump straight to the position of an error in a source
     file.  *Note Error Checking::.

   * Source code revision maintenance, which allows you to keep historic
     versions of S source files.  *Note Source Files::.

   * Facilities for evaluating S code such as portions of source files,
     or line-by-line evaluation of files (useful for debugging).  *Note
     Evaluating code::.

   Finally, ESS provides features for re-submitting commands from saved
transcript files, including:

   * Evaluation of previously entered commands, stripping away
     unnecessary prompts.  *Note Transcript resubmit::.

1.2 New features in ESS
=======================

Changes/New Features in 5.2.2:
   * bug-fixes for 5.2.1 (require 'executable), html docs, etc.

   * ess-lisp-directory/../doc/info added to Info-directory-list if
     ess-info not found by info

   * ESS[R]: If you have other versions of R on your exec-path, such as
     "R-1.8.1" with Unix or "rw1081" with Windows, ESS will find them
     and create appropriate functions, such as M-x R-1.8.1 or M-x
     rw1081, for calling them.  By default only Unix programs beginning
     "R-1" and "R-2" and Windows programs parallel to the version of R
     in your exec-path will be found, but see ess-r-versions and
     ess-rterm-versions for ways to find other versions of R.

   * ESS[R]: Other versions of R, such as "R-1.8.1" on Unix and
     "rw1081" on Windows, are added to the "ESS / Start Process /
     Other" menu.

   * ESS[S]: If you have other versions of S-Plus on your Windows
     computer, such as S-Plus 6.1 or S-Plus 4.5, ESS will find them and
     create appropriate functions, such as M-x splus61, for calling the
     console version (Sqpe) inside an emacs buffer.  By default only
     programs installed in the default location will be found, but see
     ess-SHOME-versions for ways to find other versions of S-Plus.

   * ESS[S]: Other versions of Sqpe on Windows, such as "splus61", are
     added to the "ESS / Start Process / Other" menu.

   * ESS[R]: (bug fix) ess-quit (bound to C-c C-q) should now quit the
     inferior R process, when issued from either the inferior buffer,
     or from a .R buffer.

   Changes/New Features in 5.2.1:
   * ESS[S] (R and S-plus): now have toolbar support with icons to
     evaluate code in the inferior process or to switch there.  This
     code is experimental and likely to change as XEmacs/Emacs issues
     get resolved. The toolbar should be enabled if your Emacs displays
     images, but can be disabled with the variable ess-use-toolbar.
     Thanks to David Smith from Insightful for the S-plus logo.

   * ESS[SAS]: ess-sas-graph-view (F12) enhanced; you can specify
     external file viewers for each graphics file type via the alist
     ess-sas-graph-view-viewer-alist; also .jpg/.gif are now handled by
     image-mode on XEmacs, if available, otherwise by graphics
     primitives as before

   Changes/New Features in 5.2.0:
   * ESS[BUGS]:  new info documentation!  now supports interactive
     processing thanks to Aki Vehtari (mailto:Aki.Vehtari@hut.fi); new
     architecture-independent unix support as well as support for BUGS
     v. 0.5

   * ESS[SAS]:  convert .log to .sas with ess-sas-transcript; info
     documentation improved; Local Variable bug fixes; SAS/IML
     statements/functions now highlighted; files edited remotely by
     ange-ftp/EFS/tramp are recognized and pressing SUBMIT opens a
     buffer on the remote host via the local variable
     ess-sas-shell-buffer-remote-init which defaults to "ssh"; changed
     the definition of the variable ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle to boolean
     rather than 0/1; added the function ess-electric-run-semicolon
     which automatically reverse indents lines containing only "run;";
     C-F1 creates MS RTF portrait from the current buffer; C-F2 creates
     MS RTF landscape from the current buffer; C-F9 opens a SAS DATASET
     with PROC INSIGHT rather than PROC FSVIEW; C-F10 kills all buffers
     associated with .sas program; "inferior" aliases for SAS batch:
     C-c C-r for submit region, C-c C-b for submit buffer, C-c C-x for
     goto .log; C-c C-y for goto .lst

   * ESS[S]: Pressing underscore ("_") once inserts " <- " (as before);
     pressing underscore twice inserts a literal underscore.  To stop
     this smart behaviour, add "(ess-smart-underscore nil)" to your
     .emacs after ess-site has been loaded;
     ess-dump-filename-template-proto (new name!) now can be customized
     successfully (for S language dialects); Support for Imenu has been
     improved; set ess-imenu-use-S to non-nil to get an "Imenu-S" item
     on your menubar; ess-help: Now using nice underlines (instead of
     `nuke-* ^H_')

   * ESS[R]:  After (require 'essa-r), M-x ess-r-var allows to load
     numbers from any Emacs buffer into an existing *R* process; M-x
     ess-rdired gives a "directory editor" of R objects; fixed
     ess-retr-lastvalue-command, i.e. .Last.value bug (thanks to David
     Brahm)

   * ESS: Support for creating new window frames has been added to ESS.
     Inferior ESS processes can be created in dedicated frames by
     setting inferior-ess-own-frame to t.  ESS help buffers can also
     open in new frames; see the documentation for ess-help-own-frame
     for details.  (Thanks to Kevin Rodgers for contributing code.)

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.24:
   * The version number is now correct even inside ESS/Emacs

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.23:
   * Minor more Makefile clean up.

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.22:
   * Besides info documentation, PDF and HTML documentation are also
     provided (instead of built using "make") and available on the web
     as well; see ESS web page
     (http://software.biostat.washington.edu/ess/doc) and StatLib
     (http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/general/ESS/doc)

   * Now that info documentation is available, the README.* files are
     no longer supported.  However, they are still distributed for what
     it's worth.

   * ESS is now an XEmacs package!  See XEmacs Installation HOWTO
     (http://www.xemacs.org/Install/index.html) for details
     (specifically, items 10-15).

   * ESS[SAS]: more user-friendly enhancements for remote SAS batch
     jobs with Kermit file transfers (LOG and OUTPUT function key
     features now supported).  Multiple shells now supported so you can
     run SAS on different computers from different buffers by setting
     the buffer-local variable ess-sas-shell-buffer to unique buffer
     names.

   * Major re-vamping of Makefile/Makeconf.

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.21:
   * ESS[SAS]: info documentation now available!, see ESS->Help for
     SAS; F12 opens GSASFILE nearest point for viewing either within
     emacs, when available, or via an external viewer; more syntax
     highlighting keywords; more enhancements for remote SAS batch jobs
     with Kermit; new framework for remote SAS interactive jobs, see
     ess-remote

   * ESS[S]: info documentation now available!, see ESS->Help for the S
     family

   * Makefile: tag now independent of rel; info files made by
     doc/Makefile and installed in new info sub-directory

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.20:
   * New `options()$STERM' in the S dialects (S, S-Plus, R).  The S
     program can determine the environment in which it is currently
     running.  ESS sets the option to `iESS' or `ddeESS' when it starts
     an S language process.  We recommend other specific values for S
     language processes that ESS does not start.

   * New `ess-mouse-me' function, assigned to S-mouse-3 by default.
     User may click on a word or region and then choose from the menu
     to display the item, or a summary, or a plot, etc.  This feature
     is still under development.

   * GNU Emacs 21.1 is now supported (fixed for S dialects, SAS & BUGS),
     (some from Stephen Eglen).

   * XEmacs 21.x is now supported (fixed w32-using-nt bug)

   * XEmacs on Win (NT) is better supported.

   * Workaround for bug in Sqpe+6 (S-PLUS 6 for Win).

   * should now work even when imenu is not available (for old
     Xemacsen).

   * ESS[SAS]: XEmacs-Imenu fix; C-TAB is globalized along with your
     function-key definitions, if specified; you can specify your SAS
     library definitions outside of autoexec.sas for ess-sas-data-view
     with SAS code placed in the variable ess-sas-data-view-libname,
     also the dataset name is defaulted to the nearest permanent dataset
     to point; Speedbar support now works for permanent datasets, please
     ignore first./last.; new font-locking is now the default with more
     improvements for font-locking PROCs, macro statements, * ; and %* ;
     comments; you can toggle sas-log-mode with F10 which will font-lock
     your .log (if it isn't too big); submit remote .sas files accessed
     with ange-ftp, EFS or Tramp (Kermit is experimental) by setting
     ess-sas-submit-method to 'sh; ess-sas-submit-command and
     ess-sas-submit-command-options are buffer-local so you can have
     local file variable sections at the end of your .sas files to
     request different executables or specify special options and the
     local file variables are re-read at submit instead of only at file
     open so that if you make a change it is picked up immediately;

   * ESS[BUGS]: font-lock with `in' fixed.

   * for STATA: font-lock bug fixed.

   * for Rd mode: C-c C-v and `switch-process' in menu.  further, C-c
     C-f prefix (Rd-font) for inserting or surrounding a word by things
     such as \code{.}, \code{\link{.}}, \emph{.} etc.

   * new functions (ess-directory-function) and (ess-narrow-to-defun)
     ess-directory <-> default-directory logic (Jeff Mincy).

   * Re-organized Makefile and fixed a few bugs.

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.19:
   * S+6 now supported (Tony Rossini (Unix) and Rich Heiberger
     (Windows))

   * New BUGS support through ESS[BUGS] mode (Rodney Sparapani)
     Templates assist you in writing .bug and .cmd code (.cmd and .log
     are replaced by .bmd and .bog to avoid emacs extension collisions).
     Substitution" parameters facilitate "automagic" generation of
     data...in" and "init...in" filenames, "const N=" from your data
     file and "monitor()/stats()" commands.  Activated by pressing F12.

   * Fixes for `ess-smart-underscore' SAS breakage (Rich Heiberger)

   * You can change between PC and Unix, local and global SAS
     function-key definitions interactively (Rich Heiberger)

   * C-Submit a highlighted region to SAS batch (Rodney Sparapani)

   * New and improved SAS syntax highlighting (Rodney Sparapani) To get
     the new functionality, set ess-sas-run-make-regexp to nil.  Also
     available in .log files via F10.

   * Open a permanent SAS dataset for viewing via F9 (Rodney Sparapani)
     You must have the library defined in autoexec.sas for it to work.

   * User-friendly defaults for `sas-program',
     `ess-sas-batch-pre-command' and `ess-sas-batch-post-command' as
     well Customize support for these and other ESS[SAS] variables
     (Rodney Sparapani)

   * `ess-sas-suffix-2' now defaults to .dat via F11 (Rodney Sparapani)

   * Emacs/XEmacs, Unix/Windows issues collectively handled in
     ess-emcs.el

   * defadvice solves problem of missing *ESS* (thanks to Jeff Mincy)

   * Improved manual a bit by including things that were only in
     `README'.

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.18:
   * New `ess-smart-underscore' function, now assigned to "_" by
     default.  Inserts `ess-S-assign' (customizable " <- "), unless
     inside string and comments where plain "_" is used instead. (MM)

   * Fixes for longstanding interactive SAS breakage (RMH)

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.17:
   * Documentation for Windows Installation (Rich Heiberger)

   * removal of ess-vars, finalization of customize support (in the
     sense that there is no more use of ess-vars, but that we need to
     fix ess-cust) (AJ Rossini)

   * Many small (and large) fixes/contributions (MMaechler)

   * addition of the "S-equal" variable and provide M-x ess-add-MM-keys
     a way to remap "_" to `ess-S-assign', typically " <- ", but
     customizable. (MMaechler)

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.16:
   * BUG FIXES

   * Better SAS support

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.15:
   * BUG FIXES

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.14:
   * Yet more fixes to SAS mode, (Rich Heiberger and Rodney Sparapani)

   * Version numbering finally all depending on the ./VERSION file,
     thanks to Martin Maechler.

   * Yet more fixes to SAS mode, thanks to Rich Heiberger.

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.12:
   * Splus 5.1 stabilized, thanks to Martin Maechler, Bill Venables,
     Chuck Taylor, and others.

   * More fixes to SAS mode, thanks to Rodney Sparapani and Rich
     Heiberger.

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.11:
   * More fixes to Stata mode, thanks to Brendan Halpin
     (mailto:brendan@essex.ac.uk).

   * fixed bugs in ESS-elsewhere, thanks to many testers

   * README.SPLUS4WIN has DETAILED instructions for S-PLUS 2000, thanks
     to David Brahm (mailto:brahm@alum.mit.edu).

   * Fixes to SAS mode, thanks to Rodney Sparapani

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.10:
   * More fixes to Stata mode

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.2:
   * able to use inferior iESS mode to communicate directly with a
     running S-Plus 4.x process using the Microsoft DDE protocol.  We
     use the familiar (from Unix ESS) C-c C-n and related key sequences
     to send lines from the S-mode file to the inferior S process.  We
     continue to edit S input files in ESS[S] mode and transcripts of
     previous S sessions in ESS Transcript mode.  All three modes know
     the S language, syntax, and indentation patterns and provide the
     syntactic highlighting that eases the programming tasks.

1.3 Authors of and contributors to ESS
======================================

The ESS environment is built on the open-source projects of many
contributors, dating back nearly 15 years.  Doug Bates and Ed Kademan
wrote S-mode in 1989 to edit S and Splus files in GNU Emacs.  Frank
Ritter and Mike Meyer added features, creating version 2.  Meyer and
David Smith made further contributions, creating version 3.  For
version 4, David Smith provided process interaction based on Olin
Shivers' comint package.

   John Sall wrote GNU Emacs macros for SAS source code around 1990.
Tom Cook added more functionality creating SAS-mode which was
distributed in 1994.  Also in 1994, A.J. Rossini extended S-mode to
support XEmacs.  Together with extensions written by Martin Maechler,
this became version 4.7 and supported S, Splus, and R.  In 1995,
Rossini extended SAS-mode to work with XEmacs.

   In 1997, Rossini merged S-mode and SAS-mode into a single Emacs
package for statistical programming; the product of this marriage was
called ESS version 5.

   * The multiple process code, and the idea for
     `ess-eval-line-and-next-line' are by Rod Ball.

   * Thanks to Doug Bates for many useful suggestions.

   * Thanks to Martin Maechler for reporting and fixing bugs, providing
     many useful comments and suggestions, and for maintaining the
     S-mode mailing list.

   * Thanks to Frank Ritter for updates from the previous version, the
     menu code, and invaluable comments on the manual.

   * Thanks to Ken'ichi Shibayama for his excellent indenting code, and
     many comments and suggestions.

   * Last but definitely not least, thanks to the many beta testers of
     the S-mode and ESS mailing lists.

   _ESS_ version 5 is being developed and currently maintained by

1.4 Getting the latest version of ESS
=====================================

The latest version of ESS is always available on the web at: ESS web
page (http://www.analytics.washington.edu/downloads/ess/) or StatLib
(http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/general/ESS/)

   There no longer is an anonymous CVS repository for ESS, due to lack
of interest, little demand, and problems with security.

1.5 How to read this manual
===========================

If you need to install ESS, read *Note Installation:: for details on
what needs to be done before proceeding to the next chapter.

   In this manual we use the standard notation for describing the
keystrokes used to invoke certain commands.  `C-<chr>' means hold the
CONTROL key while typing the character <chr>. `M-<chr>' means hold the
META or EDIT or ALT key down while typing <chr>. If there is no META,
EDIT or ALT key, instead press and release the ESC key and then type
<chr>.

   All ESS commands can be invoked by typing `M-x command'.  Most of
the useful commands are bound to keystrokes for ease of use.  Also, the
most popular commands are also available through the emacs menubar, and
finally, if available, a small subset are provided on the toolbar.
Where possible, keybindings are similar to other modes in emacs to
strive for a consistent user interface within emacs, regardless of the
details of which programming language is being edited, or process being
run.

   Some commands, such as `M-x R' can accept an optional `prefix'
argument.  To specify the prefix argument, you would type `C-u' before
giving the command.  e.g. If you type `C-u M-x R', you will be asked
for command line options that you wish to invoke the R process with.

   Emacs is often referred to as a `self-documenting' text editor.  This
applies to ESS in two ways.  First, limited documentation about each ESS
command can be obtained by typing `C-h f'.  For example, if you type
`C-h f ess-eval-region', documentation for that command will appear in
a separate *Help* buffer.  Second, a complete list of keybindings that
are available in each ESS mode and brief description of that mode is
available by typing `C-h m' within an ESS buffer.

   Emacs is a versatile editor written in both C and lisp; ESS is
written in the Emacs lisp dialect (termed `elisp') and thus benefits
from the flexible nature of lisp.  In particular, many aspects of ESS
behaviour can be changed by suitable customization of lisp variables.
This manual mentions some of the most frequent variables.  A full list
of them however is available by using the Custom facility within emacs.
(Type `M-x customize-group RET ess RET' to get started.)  *Note
Customization:: provides details of common user variables you can
change to customize ESS to your taste, but it is recommended that you
defer this section until you are more familiar with ESS.

Appendix A Installing ESS on your system
****************************************

The following section details those steps necessary to get ESS running
on your system.

* Menu:

* Unix installation::              Installing ESS on your Unix system
* Microsoft Windows installation:: Installing ESS on your MS Windows system
* Requirements::         emacs, Operating Systems and Statistical Packages
* System dependent::               Variables you may need to change

   We now discuss installation, which might happen under Unix or
Microsoft Windows.  First, we discuss Unix installation.  *Note Unix
installation::.

   For Microsoft Windows Installation please skip to the *Note
Microsoft Windows installation::.


File: ess.info,  Node: Unix installation,  Next: Microsoft Windows installation,  Up: Installation

A.1 Unix installation
=====================

  1. cd to a directory where you want to install ESS, creating it if
     necessary.  This directory will be referred to below as ESSDIR.

  2. Retrieve the latest version from gzipped tar file
     (http://www.analytics.washington.edu/downloads/ess/ess-VERSION.tar.gz)
     to ESSDIR.

  3. Decompress/unarchive the files from the disribution.
          gunzip ess-VERSION.tar.gz
          tar xvf ess-VERSION.tar

          (or: `gunzip < ess-VERSION.tar.gz | tar xvf -' ).
          (or using GNU tar:  `tar zxvf ess-VERSION.tar.gz').

     The `tar' command will create the subdirectory ess-VERSION and
     unarchive the files there.

  4. Edit the file `ESSDIR/ess-VERSION/lisp/ess-site.el' as explained
     in the comments section of that file.

  5.  Add the line
          (load "ESSDIR/ess-VERSION/lisp/ess-site")
     to your user or system installation file (GNU Emacs uses
     `$HOME/.emacs' and XEmacs uses `$HOME/.xemacs/init.el' for the
     user initialization file.  GNU Emacs uses default.el or
     site-init.el and XEmacs uses site-start.el for the system
     installation file).

     Alternatively, if ess-site.el is in your current Lisp path, you
     can do:
          (require 'ess-site)
     to configure emacs for ESS.

  6. That's it!  If you are installing just a local copy of ESS for
     yourself, ESS is now ready to be used.  (The remaining steps below
     are for advanced installation.)  To edit statistical programs,
     load the files with the requiste extensions (".sas" for SAS, ".S"
     for S-PLUS, ".R" for R, and ".lsp" for XLispStat).  To start a
     statistical process within Emacs, such as R, type `M-x R'.

  7. (OPTIONAL) If you are running S-PLUS or R, you might consider
     installing the database files.  From within emacs, `C-x d' to the
     directory containing ESS.  Now:
          M-x S+6
     to get S running.  Once you see the SPLUS prompt, do:
          M-x ess-create-object-name-db
     (this will create the file `ess-s+6-namedb.el'; if it isn't in the
     ESS directory, move it there).

     Then, completions will be autoloaded and will not be regenerated
     for every session.

     For R, do the same, using
          M-x R
     and then `M-x ess-create-object-name-db' creating
     `ess-r-namedb.el'; if it isn't in the ESS directory, move it
     there).

  8. (OPTIONAL) READ THIS ITEM THOROUGHLY BEFORE STARTING:

     If you want to place the compiled files in other locations edit
     the LISPDIR and INFODIR entries in `Makeconf' in the
     ESSDIR/ess-VERSION directory (if you are using XEmacs, then you
     also need to edit the EMACS entry as follows:  EMACS=xemacs).

     You can compile those files by:
          make all

     When that completes successfully, install the compiled files:
          make install

     This will install the compiled info files and lisp files.  If you
     are an XEmacs user, then you should be done.  If not, then you may
     have to edit/create the file `dir' that is found in the directory
     specified by `INFODIR': see the sample `dir' in
     ESSDIR/ess-VERSION/doc/info.  If `dir' does not exist in
     `INFODIR', then the sample `dir' will be installed.

     _Note 1:_ It is assumed that GNU make will be used; otherwise,
     edit the ESSVERSION and ESSVERSIONTAG entries in `Makeconf'
     appropriately, e.g.: ESSVERSION=5.2.0 and ESSVERSIONTAG=ESS-5-2-0

     _Note 2:_  ESS can be installed for XEmacs as an XEmacs package
     much more easily than what has been described anywhere above.
     However, the latest ESS version will not be available at the same
     time as an XEmacs package; generally, it can take weeks or months
     to appear in the latter format.  For more information on
     installing ESS as an XEmacs package see Quickstart Package Guide
     (http://www.xemacs.org/Documentation/packageGuide.html).



File: ess.info,  Node: Microsoft Windows installation,  Next: Requirements,  Prev: Unix installation,  Up: Installation

A.2 Microsoft Windows installation
==================================

For Microsoft Windows installation, please follow the next steps: (see
separate instructions above for UNIX *Note Unix installation::.

  1. cd to a directory where you keep emacs lisp files, or create a new
     directory (for example, `c:\emacs\') to hold the distribution.
     This directory will be referred to below as "the ESS distribution
     directory".  It will contain, at the end, either the tar file
     `ess-VERSION.tar.gz' or the zip file `ess-VERSION.zip', and a
     directory for the ESS source, which will be termed "the
     ESS-VERSION source directory".

  2. Retrieve the compressed tar file `ess-VERSION.tar.gz' or the
     zipped file `ess-VERSION.zip' from one of the FTP or WWW archive
     sites via FTP (or HTTP).  Be aware that http browsers on Windows
     frequently change the "." and "-" characters in filenames to other
     punctuation.  Please change the names back to their original form.

  3. Copy `ess-VERSION.tar.gz' to the location where you want the
     ess-VERSION directory, for example to
     `c:\emacs\ess-VERSION.tar.gz', and cd there.  For example,

          cd c:\emacs

     Extract the files from the distribution, which will unpack into a
     subdirectory, `ess-VERSION'.
          gunzip ess-VERSION.tar.gz
          tar xvf ess-VERSION.tar
          (or: `gunzip < ess-VERSION.tar.gz | tar xvf -' ).
          (or: from the zip file: `unzip ess-VERSION.zip')

     The `tar' command will extract files into the current directory.

     Do not create `ess-VERSION' yourself, or you will get an extra
     level of depth to your directory structure.

  4. Windows users will usually be able to use the `lisp/ess-site.el'
     as distributed.  Only rarely will changes be needed.

  5. Windows users will need to make sure that the directories for the
     software they will be using is in the PATH environment variable.
     On Windows 9x, add lines similar to the following to your
     `c:\autoexec.bat' file:
          path=%PATH%;c:\progra~1\spls2000\cmd
     On Windows NT/2000/XP, add the directories to the PATH using the
     `My Computer/Control Panel/System/Advanced/Environment Variables'
     menu.  Note that the directory containing the program is added to
     the PATH, not the program itself.  One such line is needed for
     each software program.  Be sure to use the abbreviation `progra~1'
     and not the long version with embedded blanks.  Use backslashes
     "\".

  6. Add the line
          (load "/PATH/ess-site")
     to your .emacs (or _emacs) file (or default.el or site-init.el, for
     a site-wide installation).  Replace `/PATH' above with the value
     of ess-lisp-directory as defined in `ess-site.el'.  Use
     forwardslashes `/'.  (GNU Emacs uses the filename `%HOME%/.emacs'
     and XEmacs uses the filename `%HOME%/.xemacs/init.el' for the
     initialization file.)

  7. To edit statistical programs, load the files with the requisite
     extensions  (".sas" for SAS, ".S" or "s" or "q" or "Q" for S-PLUS,
     ".r" or ".R" for R, and ".lsp"   for XLispStat).

  8. To run statistical processes under emacs:

     To start the S-PLUS 6.x GUI from ESS under emacs:
          M-x S
          (or `M-x S+6').
     You will then be asked for a pathname ("S starting data
     directory?"), from which to start the process.  The prompt will
     propose your current directory as the default.  ESS will start the
     S-PLUS GUI.  There will be slight delay during which emacs is
     temporarily frozen.  ESS will arrange for communication with the
     S-PLUS GUI using the DDE protocol.  Send lines or regions from the
     emacs buffer containing your S program (for example, `myfile.s')
     to the S-PLUS Commands Window with the `C-c C-n' or `C-c C-r' keys.
     (If you are still using S-PLUS 4.x or 2000, then use `M-x S+4'.)

     To start an S-PLUS 6.x session inside an emacs buffer--and without
     the S-PLUS GUI:
          M-x Sqpe
          (or `M-x Sqpe+6').
     You will then be asked for a pathname ("S starting data
     directory?"), from which to start the process.  The prompt will
     propose your current directory as the default.  You get Unix-like
     behavior, in particular the entire transcript is available for
     emacs-style search commands.  Send lines or regions from the emacs
     buffer containing your S program (for example, `myfile.s') to the
     *S+6* buffer with the `C-c C-n' or `C-c C-r' keys.  Interactive
     graphics are available with Sqpe by using the java library
     supplied with S-PLUS 6.1 and newer releases.  Enter the commands:
          library(winjava)
          java.graph()
     Graphs can be saved from the `java.graph' device in several
     formats, but not PostScript.   If you need a PostScript file you
     will need to open a separate `postscript' device.  (If you are
     still using S-PLUS 4.x or 2000, then use `M-x Sqpe+4'.)

     To connect to an already running S-PLUS GUI (started, for example,
     from the S-PLUS icon):
          M-x S+6-existing
     You will then be asked for a pathname ("S starting data
     directory?"), from which to start the process.  The prompt will
     propose your current directory as the default.  ESS will arrange
     for communication with the already running S-PLUS GUI using the
     DDE protocol.  Send lines or regions from the emacs buffer
     containing your S program (for example, `myfile.s') to the S-PLUS
     Commands Window with the `C-c C-n' or `C-c C-r' keys.  (If you are
     still using S-PLUS 4.x or 2000, then use `M-x S+4-existing'.)

     If you wish to run R, you can start it with:
          M-x R

     XLispStat can not currently be run with
          M-x XLS
     Hopefully, this will change.  However, you can still edit with
     emacs, and cut and paste the results into the XLispStat *Listener*
     Window under Microsoft Windows.

  9. (OPTIONAL) If you are running Sqpe or R, you might consider
     installing the database files.  From within emacs, `C-x d' to the
     directory containing ESS.  Now:
          M-x Sqpe+6
     to get S running.  Once you see the SPLUS prompt, do:
          M-x ess-create-object-name-db
     (this will create the file `ess-s+6-namedb.el'; if it isn't in the
     ESS directory, move it there).

     Then, completions will be autoloaded and will not be regenerated
     for every session.

     For R, do the same, using
          M-x R
     and then `M-x ess-create-object-name-db' creating
     `ess-r-namedb.el'; if it isn't in the ESS directory, move it
     there).

 10. That's it!

Variables updating problem

   (2) These releases of emacs are no longer supported, so an upgrade
is recommended if you plan to use ESS.  If you have GNU Emacs 19.29,
see *Note Unix installation::.  Also, note that the `custom' library
bundled with Emacs 19.34 is too _old_, its API is incompatible with the
`new custom' bundled with recent Emacsen.  The `new custom' for Emacs
19.34 is available for download here
(ftp://ftp.dina.kvl.dk/pub/Staff/Per.Abrahamsen/custom/custom-1.9962.tar.gz).


File: ess.info,  Node: System dependent,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Installation

A.4 Variables you may need to change
====================================

If you run the S program (from the shell) with a command other than
`Splus' you will need to set the variable `inferior-ess-program' to the
name of the appropriate program by including a line such as 

     (setq inferior-ess-program "S+")
   in your `.emacs' file (substituting `S+' for the name of your S
program.)

   If you need to call this program with any arguments, the variable you need
to set is dependent on the value of `inferior-ess-program'; for example
if it is `"Splus"', set the variable `inferior-Splus-args' to a string
of arguments to the `Splus' program.  If `inferior-ess-program' has
some other value, substitute the `Splus' part of `inferior-Splus-args'
with the appropriate program name.  There aren't many instances where
you need to call S with arguments, however: in particular do not call
the S program with the `-e' command-line editor argument since ESS
provides this feature for you.

   If you are running Splus (the enhanced version of S from Statsci) you
may also need to set the variable `S-plus' to `t'.  If your value of
`inferior-ess-program' is `"S+"' or `Splus' this will not be necessary,
however; `S-plus' defaults to `t' in this case.

   Finally, if you use a non-standard prompt within S, you will need to
set the variable `inferior-ess-prompt' to a regular expression which
will match both the primary prompt (`"> "' by default) and the
continuing prompt (default of `"+ "'.) The default value of this
variable matches S's default prompts.  For example, if you use (`"$ "')
as your primary prompt (you have `options(prompt="$ ")' in your
`.First' function), add the following line to your `.emacs':
     (setq inferior-ess-prompt "^\\(\\+\\|[^\\$]*\\$\\) *")
   You will also need to set the variable `inferior-ess-primary-prompt' to
a regular expression which matches the primary prompt only.  Do not
anchor the regexp to the beginning of the line with `^'.  Once again,
the default value matches S's default prompt; in the example above the
appropriate value would be `"[^\\$]*\\$ *"'.

   Once these variables are set appropriately, ESS should work on any
system.

2 Interacting with statistical programs
***************************************

As well as using ESS to edit your source files for statistical programs,
you can ESS to run these statistical programs.  In this chapter, we
mostly will refer by example to running S from within emacs.  The emacs
convention is to name such proceses running under its control as
`inferior processes'.  This term can be slightly misleading, in which
case these processes can be thought of `interactive processes'.  Either
way, we use the term `iESS' to refer to the Emacs mode used to interact
with statistical programs.

* S+elsewhere and ESS-elsewhere::

File: ess.info,  Node: Starting up,  Next: Multiple ESS processes,  Up: Interactive ESS

2.1 Starting an ESS process
===========================

To start an S session, simply type `M-x S RET'.  

   S will then (by default) ask the question
     S starting data directory?
   Enter the name of the directory you wish to start S from (that is,
the directory you would have `cd''d to before starting S from the
shell).  This directory should have a `.Data' subdirectory.

   You will then be popped into a buffer with name `*S*' which will be
used for interacting with the ESS process, and you can start entering
commands.


File: ess.info,  Node: Multiple ESS processes,  Next: ESS processes on Remote Computers,  Prev: Starting up,  Up: Interactive ESS

2.2 Running more than one ESS process
=====================================

ESS allows you to run more than one ESS process simultaneously in the
same session.  Each process has a name and a number; the initial process (process
1) is simply named (using S-PLUS as an example) `S+3:1'.  The name of
the process is shown in the mode line in square brackets (for example,
`[S+3:2]'); this is useful if the process buffer is renamed.  Without a
prefix argument, `M-x S' starts a new ESS process, using the first
available process number.  With a prefix argument (for R), `C-u M-x R'
allows for the specification of command line options.

   You can switch to any active ESS process with the command `M-x
ess-request-a-process'.  Just enter the name of the process you
require; completion is provided over the names of all running S
processes.  This is a good command to consider binding to a global key.


File: ess.info,  Node: ESS processes on Remote Computers,  Next: Customizing startup,  Prev: Multiple ESS processes,  Up: Interactive ESS

2.3 ESS processes on Remote Computers
=====================================

ESS works with processes on remote computers as easily as with
processes on the local machine.  The recommended way to access a
statistical program on remote computer is to start it from a telnet or
ssh buffer and then connect ESS to that buffer.

  1. Start a new telnet or ssh buffer and connect to the remote computer
     (e.g. use `M-x telnet' or `M-x ssh'; ssh.el is available at
     `ftp://ftp.splode.com/pub/users/friedman/emacs-lisp/ssh.el').

  2. Start the ESS process on the remote machine, for example with one
     of the commands `Splus', or `R', or `sas -stdio'.

  3. Enter the ESS command `M-x ess-remote'.  You will be prompted for
     a program name.  Enter `sp6' or `r' or `sas' or another valid
     name.  Your telnet process is now known to ESS.  All the usual ESS
     commands (`C-c C-n' and its relatives) now work with the S
     language processes.  For SAS you need to use a different command
     `C-c i' (that is a regular `i', not a `C-i') to send lines from
     your `myfile.sas' to the remote SAS process.  `C-c i' sends lines
     over invisibly.  With ess-remote you get teletype behavior--the
     data input, the log, and the listing all appear in the same
     buffer.  To make this work, you need to end every PROC and DATA
     step with a "RUN;" statement.  The "RUN;" statement is what tells
     SAS that it should process the preceding input statements.

  4. Graphics (interactive) on the remote machine.  If you run X11
     (*Note X11::, X-windows) on both the local and remote machines
     then you should be able to display the graphs locally by setting
     the `DISPLAY' environment variable appropriately.  Windows users
     can download `xfree86' from cygwin.

  5. Graphics (static) on the remote machine.  If you don't run the X
     window system on the local machine, then you can write graphics to
     a file on the remote machine, and display the file in a graphics
     viewer on the local machine.  Most statistical software can write
     one or more of postscript, GIF, or JPEG files.  Depending on the
     versions of emacs and the operating system that you are running,
     emacs itself may display `.gif' and `.jpg' files.  Otherwise, a
     graphics file viewer will be needed.  Ghostscript/ghostview may be
     downloaded to display `.ps' and `.eps' files.  Viewers for GIF and
     JPEG are usually included with operating systems.  *Note
     ESS(SAS)--Function keys for batch processing::, for more
     information on using the F12 key for displaying graphics files
     with SAS.

   Should you or a colleague inadvertently start a statistical process
in an ordinary `*shell*' buffer, the `ess-remote' command can be used
to convert it to an ESS buffer and allow you to use the ESS commands
with it.

   We have two older commands, now deprecated, for accessing ESS
processes on remote computers.  *Note S+elsewhere and ESS-elsewhere::.


File: ess.info,  Node: S+elsewhere and ESS-elsewhere,  Prev: ESS processes on Remote Computers,  Up: ESS processes on Remote Computers

2.4 S+elsewhere and ESS-elsewhere
=================================

These commands are now deprecated.  We recommend `ess-remote'.

   We have two versions of the elsewhere function.

   `S+elsewhere' is specific for the S-Plus program.  The more general
function `ESS-elsewhere' is not as stable.

  1. Enter `M-x S+elsewhere'.  You will be prompted for a starting
     directory.  I usually give it my project directory on the local
     machine, say  `~myname/myproject/'

     Or enter `M-x ESS-elsewhere'.  You will be prompted for an ESS
     program and for a starting directory.  I usually give it my project
     directory on the local machine, say `~myname/myproject/'

  2. The `*S+3*' buffer will appear with a prompt from the local
     operating system (the unix prompt on a unix workstation or with
     cygwin bash on a PC, or the msdos prompt on a PC without bash).
     emacs may freeze because the cursor is at the wrong place.
     Unfreeze it with `C-g' then move the cursor to the end with `M->'.
     With `S+elsewhere' the buffer name is based on the name of the ESS
     program.

  3. Enter `telnet myname@other.machine' (or `ssh
     myname@other.machine').  You will be prompted for your password on
     the remote machine.  Use `M-x send-invisible' before typing the
     password itself.

  4. Before starting the ESS process, type `stty -echo nl' at the unix
     prompt.  The `-echo' turns off the echo, the `nl' turns off the
     newline that you see as `^M'.

  5. You are now talking to the unix prompt on the other machine in the
     `*S+3*' buffer.  cd into the directory for the current project and
     start the ESS process by entering `Splus' or `R' or `sas -stdio'
     as appropriate.  If you can login remotely to your Windows 2000,
     then you should be able to run `Sqpe' on the Windows machine.  I
     haven't tested this and noone has reported their tests to me.  You
     will not be able to run the GUI through this text-only connection.

  6. Once you get the S or R or SAS prompt, then you are completely
     connected.  All the `C-c C-n' and related commands work correctly
     in sending commands from `myfile.s' or `myfile.r' on the PC to the
     `*S+3*' buffer running the S or R or SAS program on the remote
     machine.

  7. Graphics on the remote machine works fine.  If you run the X window
     sysyem on the remote unix machine you should be able to display
     them in `xfree86' on your PC.  If you don't run X11, then you can
     write graphics to the postscript device and copy it to your PC
     with dired and display it with ghostscript.

2.5 Changing the startup actions
================================

If you do not wish ESS to prompt for a starting directory when starting
a new process, set the variable `ess-ask-for-ess-directory' to `nil'.
In this case, the value of the variable `ess-directory' is used as the
starting directory.  The default value for this variable is your home
directory.  If `ess-ask-for-ess-directory' has a non-`nil' value (as it
does by default) then the value of `ess-directory' provides the default
when prompting for the starting directory.  Incidentally,
`ess-directory' is an ideal variable to set in `ess-pre-run-hook'.

   If you like to keep a record of your S sessions, set the variable
`ess-ask-about-transfile' to `t', and you will be asked for a filename
for the transcript before the ESS process starts.

 -- User Option: ess-ask-about-transfile
     If non-`nil', as for a file name in which to save the session
     transcript.

   Enter the name of a file in which to save the transcript at the
prompt.  If the file doesn't exist it will be created (and you should
give it a file name ending in `.St'); if the file already exists the
transcript will be appended to the file.  (Note: if you don't set this
variable but you still want to save the transcript, you can still do it
later -- *note Saving transcripts::.)

   Once these questions are answered (if they are asked at all) the S
process itself is started by calling the program name specified in the
variable `inferior-ess-program'.  If you need to pass any arguments to
this program, they may be specified in the variable
`inferior-S_PROGRAM_NAME-args' (e.g. if `inferior-ess-program' is
`"S+"' then the variable to set is `inferior-S+-args'.  It is not
normally necessary to pass arguments to the S program; in particular do
not pass the `-e' option to `Splus', since ESS provides its own command
history mechanism.

   By default, the new process will be displayed in another window in
the current frame.  If you wish your S process to appear in a separate
variable, customize the variable `inferior-ess-own-frame'.

3.1 ESS[S]-Editing files
========================

ESS[S] is the mode for editing S language files.  This mode handles:

   -  proper indenting, generated by both [Tab] and [Return].

   -  color and font choices based on syntax.

   -  ability to send the contents of an entire buffer, a highlighted
     region, an S function, or a single line to an inferior S process,
     if   one is currently running.

   -  ability to switch between processes which would be the target of
     the   buffer (for the above).

   -  The ability to request help from an S process for variables and
     functions, and to have the results sent into a separate buffer.

   -  completion of object names and file names.

   ESS[S] mode should be automatically turned on when loading a file
with the suffices found in ess-site (*.R, *.S, *.s, etc).  However, one
will have to start up an inferior process to take advantage of the
interactive features.

3.2 iESS[S]-Inferior ESS processes
==================================

iESS (inferior ESS) is the mode for interfacing with active statistical
processes (programs).  This mode handles:

   -  proper indenting, generated by both [Tab] and [Return].

   -  color and font highlighting based on syntax.

   -  ability to resubmit the contents of a multi-line command  to the
     executing process with a single keystroke [RET].

   -  The ability to request help from the current process for variables
     and functions, and to have the results sent into a separate
     buffer.

   -  completion of object names and file names.

   -  interactive history mechanism.

   -  transcript recording and editing.

   To start up iESS mode, use:
        M-x S+3
        M-x S4
        M-x R

   (for S-PLUS 3.x, S4, and R, respectively.  This assumes that you have
access to each).  Usually the site will have defined one of these
programs (by default S+3) to the simpler name:

   M-x S

   Note that R has some extremely useful command line arguments.  For
example, `--vanilla' will ensure R starts up without loading in any init
files.  To enter a command line argument, call R using a "prefix
argument", by

   C-u M-x R

   and when ESS prompts for "Starting Args ? ", enter (for example):

   `--vanilla'

   Then that R process will be started up using `R --vanilla'.

   Menubar access to other versions of R and Sqpe

   If you have other versions of R or S-Plus available on the system,
ESS is also able to start those versions.

   R on Unix systems: If you have "R-1.8.1" on your `exec-path', it can
be started using `M-x R-1.8.1'.  By default, ESS will find versions of
R beginning "R-1" or "R-2".  If your versions of R are called other
names, consider renaming them with a symbolic link or change the
variable `ess-r-versions'.  To see which defuns have been created for
starting different versions of R, type `M-x R-' and then hit [Tab].
You will then see if any defuns for particular versions of R have been
created.  These other versions of R can also be started from the "ESS /
Start Process / Other" menu.

   R on Windows systems: If you have "rw1081" on your `exec-path', it
can be started using `M-x rw1081'.  By default, ESS will find versions
of R located in directories parallel to the version of R in your
`PATH'.  If your versions of R are called other names, you will need to
change the variable `ess-rterm-versions'.  To see which defuns have
been created for starting different versions of R, type `M-x rw' and
then hit [Tab].  You will then see if any defuns for particular
versions of R have been created.  These other versions of R can also be
started from the "ESS / Start Process / Other" menu.

   Sqpe (S-Plus running inside an emacs buffer) on Windows systems: If
you have an older version of S-Plus (S-Plus 6.1 for example) on your
system, ir can be started inside an emacs buffer with `M-x splus61'.  By
default, ESS will find versions of S-Plus located in the installation
directories that Insightful uses by default.  If your versions of
S-Plus are anywhere else, you will need to change the variable
`ess-SHOME-versions'.  To see which defuns have been created for
starting different versions of S-Plus, type `M-x spl' and then hit
[Tab].  You will then see if any defuns for particular versions of
S-Plus have been created.  These other versions of S-Plus can also be
started from the "ESS / Start Process / Other" menu.

   New for ESS 5.1.2 (and later):  "S-elsewhere" command

   The idea of "M-x S-elsewhere" is that we open a telnet (or rlogin)
to another machine, call the buffer "*S-elsewhere*", and then run S
on the other machine in that buffer.  We do that by defining "sh" as
the inferior-S-elsewhere-program-name.  Emacs sets it up in a
"*S-elsewhere*" iESS buffer.  The user does a telnet or login from
that buffer to the other machine and then starts S on the other
machine.  The usual C-c C-n commands from myfile.s on the local
machine get sent through the buffer "*S-elsewhere*" to be executed   by
S on the other machine.

3.3 Handling and Reusing Transcripts
====================================

- edit transcript.

   - color and font highlighting based on syntax.

   - resubmit multi-line commands to an active process buffer.

   - The ability to request help from an S process for variables and
functions, and to have the results sent into a separate buffer.

   - ability to switch between processes which would be the target of
the   buffer (for the above).

3.4 ESS-help-assistance with viewing help
=========================================

ESS has built-in facilities for viewing help files from S.  *Note
Help::.


File: ess.info,  Node: Philosophies for using ESS(S),  Next: Scenarios for use (possibilities--based on actual usage),  Prev: ESS-help--assistance with viewing help,  Up: Help for the S family

3.5 Philosophies for using ESS[S]
=================================

The first is preferred, and configured for.  The second one can be
retrieved again, by changing emacs variables.

   1: (preferred by the current group of developers):  The source code
is    real.  The objects are realizations of the source code.  Source
for EVERY user modified object is placed in a particular directory
or directories, for later editing and retrieval.

   2: (older version): S objects are real.  Source code is a temporary
 realization of the objects.  Dumped buffers should not be saved.
_We_strongly_discourage_this_approach_.  However, if you insist,    add
the following lines to your .emacs file:
     (setq ess-keep-dump-files 'nil)
     (setq ess-delete-dump-files t)
     (setq ess-mode-silently-save nil)
   The second saves a small amount of disk space.  The first allows for
better portability as well as external version control for code.

3.6 Scenarios for use (possibilities-based on actual usage)
===========================================================

We present some basic suggestions for using ESS to interact with S.
These are just a subset of approaches, many better approaches are
possible.  Contributions of examples of how you work with ESS are
appreciated (especially since it helps us determine priorities on
future enhancements)! (comments as to what should be happening are
prefixed by "##").
     1:  ##    Data Analysis Example (source code is real)
         ## Load the file you want to work with
         C-x C-f myfile.s

         ## Edit as appropriate, and then start up S-PLUS 3.x
         M-x S+3

         ## A new buffer *S+3:1* will appear.  Splus will have been started
         ## in this buffer.  The buffer is in iESS [S+3:1] mode.

         ## Split the screen and go back to the file editing buffer.
         C-x 2 C-x b myfile.s

         ## Send regions, lines, or the entire file contents to S-PLUS.  For regions,
         ## highlight a region with keystrokes or mouse and then send with:
         C-c C-r

         ## Re-edit myfile.s as necessary to correct any difficulties.  Add
         ## new commands here.  Send them to S by region with C-c C-r, or
         ## one line at a time with C-c C-n.

         ## Save the revised myfile.s with C-x C-s.

         ## Save the entire *S+3:1* interaction buffer with C-c C-s.  You
         ## will be prompted for a file name.  The recommended name is
         ## myfile.St.  With the *.St suffix, the file will come up in ESS
         ## Transcript mode the next time it is accessed from Emacs.



     2:  ## Program revision example (source code is real)

         ## Start up S-PLUS 3.x in a process buffer (this will be *S+3:1*)
         M-x S+3

         ## Load the file you want to work with
         C-x C-f myfile.s

         ## edit program, functions, and code in myfile.s, and send revised
         ## functions to S when ready with
         C-c C-f
         ## or highlighted regions with
         C-c C-r
         ## or individual lines with
         C-c C-n
         ## or load the entire buffer with
         C-c C-l

         ## save the revised myfile.s when you have finished
         C-c C-s



     3:  ## Program revision example (S object is real)

         ## Start up S-PLUS 3.x in a process buffer (this will be *S+3:1*)
         M-x S+3

         ## Dump an existing S object my.function into a buffer to work with
         C-c C-d my.function
         ## a new buffer named yourloginname.my.function.S will be created with
         ## an editable copy of the object.  The buffer is associated with the
         ## pathname /tmp/yourloginname.my.function.S and will amlost certainly not
         ## exist after you log off.

         ## enter program, functions, and code into work buffer, and send
         ## entire contents to S-PLUS when ready
         C-c C-b

         ## Go to *S+3:1* buffer, which is the process buffer, and examine
         ## the results.
         C-c C-y
         ## The sequence C-c C-y is a shortcut for:  C-x b *S+3:1*

         ## Return to the work buffer (may/may not be prefixed)
         C-x C-b yourloginname.my.function.S
         ## Fix the function that didn't work, and resubmit by placing the
         ## cursor somewhere in the function and
         C-c C-f
         ## Or you could've selected a region (using the mouse, or keyboard
         ## via setting point/mark) and
         C-c C-r
         ## Or you could step through, line by line, using
         C-c C-n
         ## Or just send a single line (without moving to the next) using
         C-c C-j
         ## To fix that error in syntax for the "rchisq" command, get help
         ## by
         C-c C-v rchisq


     4:    Data Analysis (S object is real)
         ## Start up S-PLUS 3.x, in a process buffer (this will be *S+3:1*)
         M-x S+3

         ## Work in the process buffer.  When you find an object that needs
         ## to be changed (this could be a data frame, or a variable, or a
         ## function), dump it to a buffer:
         C-c C-d my.cool.function

         ## Edit the function as appropriate, and dump back in to the
         ## process buffer
         C-c C-b

         ## Return to the S-PLUS process buffer
         C-c C-y
         ## Continue working.

         ## When you need help, use
         C-c C-v rchisq
         ## instead of entering:   help("rchisq")

3.7 Customization Examples and Solutions to Problems
====================================================

1. Suppose that you are primarily an SPLUS 3.4 user, occasionally
using S version 4, and sick and tired of the buffer-name *S+3*    we've
stuck you with.  Simply edit the "ess-dialect" alist entry in    the
essd-sp3.el and essd-s4.el files to be "S" instead of "S4" and
"S+3".  This will ensure that all the inferior process buffer names
are "*S*".

   2. Suppose that you WANT to have the first buffer name indexed by
":1", in the same manner as your S-PLUS processes 2,3,4, and 5 (for
you heavy simulation people).  Then uncomment the line in ess-site
(or add after your (require 'ess-site) or (load "ess-site") command
in your .emacs file, the line:
     (setq ess-plain-first-buffername nil)
      )

   3. Fontlocking sometimes fails to behave nicely upon errors.  When
Splus dumps, a mis-matched "  (double-quote) can result in the
wrong font-lock face being used for the remainder of the buffer.

   Solution: add a " at the end of the "Dumped..." statement, to
revert the font-lock face back to normal.

   ESS[SAS] was designed for use with SAS.  It is descended from emacs
macros developed by John Sall for editing SAS programs and SAS-mode by
Tom Cook.  Those editing features and new advanced features are part of
ESS[SAS].  The user interface of ESS[SAS] has similarities with ESS[S]
and the SAS Display Manager.


File: ess.info,  Node: ESS(SAS)--Design philosophy,  Next: ESS(SAS)--Editing files,  Prev: Help for SAS,  Up: Help for SAS

4.1 ESS[SAS]-Design philosophy
==============================

ESS[SAS] was designed to aid the user in writing and maintaining SAS
programs, such as myfile.sas.  Both interactive and batch submission of
SAS programs is supported.

   ESS[SAS] was written with two primary goals.

   1. The emacs text editor provides a powerful and flexible development
environment for programming languages.  These features are a boon to all
programmers and, with the help of ESS[SAS], to SAS users as well.

   2. Although a departure from SAS Display Manager, ESS[SAS] provides
similar key definitions to give novice ESS[SAS] users a head start.
Also, inconvenient SAS Display Manager features, like remote submission
and syntax highlighting, are provided transparently; appealing to
advanced ESS[SAS] users.


File: ess.info,  Node: ESS(SAS)--Editing files,  Next: ESS(SAS)--TAB key,  Prev: ESS(SAS)--Design philosophy,  Up: Help for SAS

4.2 ESS[SAS]-Editing files
==========================

ESS[SAS] is the mode for editing SAS language files.  This mode handles:

     - proper indenting, generated by both [Tab] and [Return].
     - color and font choices based on syntax.
     - ability to send the contents of an entire buffer, a highlighted region,
       or a single line to an interactive SAS process.
     - ability to switch between processes which would be the target of the
       buffer (for the above).
     - ability to save and submit the file you are working on as a batch SAS
       process with a single keypress and to continue editing while it is runs
       in the background.
     - capability of killing the batch SAS process through the shell buffer or
       allow the SAS process to keep on running after you exit emacs.
     - single keypress navigation of .sas, .log and .lst files (.log and .lst
       files are automatically refreshed with each keypress).

   ESS[SAS] is automatically turned on when editing a file with a .sas
suffix (or other extension, if specified via auto-mode-alist).  The
function keys can be enabled to use the same function keys that the SAS
Display Manager does.  The interactive capabilities of ESS require you
to start an inferior SAS process with M-x SAS (*Note
iESS(SAS)--Interactive SAS processes::.)

   At this writing, the indenting and syntax highlighting are generally
correct.  Known issues: for multiple line * or %* comments, only the
first line is highlighted; for .log files, only the first line of a
NOTE:, WARNING: or ERROR: message is highlighted; unmatched
single/double quotes in CARDS data lines are NOT ignored; in a DO ... TO
or a DO ... TO ... BY statement, TOs are not highlighted (and neither is
BY).


File: ess.info,  Node: ESS(SAS)--TAB key,  Next: ESS(SAS)--Batch SAS processes,  Prev: ESS(SAS)--Editing files,  Up: Help for SAS

4.3 ESS[SAS]-TAB key
====================

Two options.  The TAB key is bound by default to sas-indent-line.  This
function is used to syntactically indent SAS code so PROC and RUN are in
the left margin, other statements are indented 4 spaces from the margin,
continuation lines are indented 4 spaces in from the beginning column of
that statement.  This is the type of functionality that emacs provides
in most programming language modes.  This functionality is equivalent to
uncommenting the following line in ess-site.el:
     (setq ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle nil)

   ESS provides an alternate behavior for the TAB key that makes it
behave as it does in SAS Display Manager, i.e. move the cursor to the
next tab stop.  The alternate behavior also provides a backwards TAB,
C-TAB, that moves the cursor to the tab stop to the left and deletes
any characters between them.  This functionality is obtained by
uncommenting the following line in ess-site.el:
     (setq ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle t)
   Under the alternate behavior, the TAB key is bound to tab-to-tab-stop
and the tab stops are set at multiples of sas-indent-width.


File: ess.info,  Node: ESS(SAS)--Batch SAS processes,  Next: ESS(SAS)--Function keys for batch processing,  Prev: ESS(SAS)--TAB key,  Up: Help for SAS

4.4 ESS[SAS]-Batch SAS processes
================================

Submission of a SAS batch job is dependent on your environment.
ess-sas-submit-method is determined by your operating system and your
shell.  It defaults to 'sh unless you are running Windows or Mac
Classic.  Under Windows, it will default to 'sh if you are using a
Unix-imitating shell; otherwise 'ms-dos for an MS-DOS shell.  On Mac OS
X, it will default to 'sh, but under Mac Classic AppleScript is used
('apple-script).  You will also set this to 'sh if the SAS batch job
needs to run on a remote machine rather than your local machine.  This
works transparently if you are editing the remote file via ange-ftp/EFS
or tramp.  Note that ess-sas-shell-buffer-remote-init is a Local
Variable that defaults to "ssh" which will be used to open the buffer on
the remote host and it is assumed that no password is necessary, i.e.
you are using the equivalent of ssh-agent/ssh-add (see the discussion
about Local Variables below if you need to change the default).

   However, if you are editing the file locally and transferring it back
and forth with Kermit, you need some additional steps.  First, start
Kermit locally before remotely logging in.  Open a local copy of the
file with the ess-kermit-prefix character prepended (the default is
"#").  Execute the command ess-kermit-get which automatically brings the
contents of the remote file into your local copy.  If you transfer files
with Kermit manually in a shell buffer, then note that the Kermit escape
sequence is C-q C-\ c rather than C-\ c which it would be in an ordinary
terminal application, i.e. not in an emacs buffer.  Lastly, note that
the remote Kermit command is specified by ess-kermit-command.

   The command used by the SUBMIT function key (F3 or F8) to submit a
batch SAS job, whether local or remote, is ess-sas-submit-command which
defaults to sas-program.  sas-program is "invoke SAS using program file"
for Mac Classic and "sas" otherwise.  However, you may have to alter
ess-sas-submit-command for a particular program, so it is defined as
buffer-local.  Conveniently, it can be set at the end of the program:
     endsas;
     Local variables:
     ess-sas-submit-command: "sas8"
     End:

   The command line is also made of ess-sas-submit-pre-command,
ess-sas-submit-post-command and ess-sas-submit-command-options (the
last of which is also buffer-local).  Here are some examples for your
.emacs file (you may also use M-x customize-variable):
     ;'sh default
     (setq ess-sas-submit-pre-command "nohup")
     ;'sh default
     (setq ess-sas-submit-post-command "-rsasuser &")
     ;'sh example
     (setq-default ess-sas-submit-command "/usr/local/sas/sas")
     ;'ms-dos default
     (setq ess-sas-submit-pre-command "start")
     ;'ms-dos default
     (setq ess-sas-submit-post-command "-rsasuser -icon")
     ;Windows example
     (setq-default ess-sas-submit-command "c:/progra~1/sas/sas.exe")
     ;Windows example
     (setq-default ess-sas-submit-command "c:\\progra~1\\sas\\sas.exe")

   There is a built-in delay before a batch SAS job is submitted when
using a Unix-imitating shell under Windows.  This is necessary in many
cases since the shell might not be ready to receive a command.  This
delay is currently set high enough so as not to be a problem.  But,
there may be cases when it needs to be set higher, or could be set much
lower to speed things up.  You can over-ride the default in your .emacs
file by:
     (setq ess-sleep-for 0.2)

   For example, open the file you want to work with
(ess-sas-global-unix-keys keys shown, ess-sas-global-pc-keys in
parentheses; ESS[SAS] function keys are presented in the next section).
     C-x C-f myfile.sas
   myfile.sas will be in ESS[SAS] mode.  Edit as appropriate, then save
and submit the batch SAS job.
     F3 (F8)
   The job runs in the shell buffer while you continue to edit
myfile.sas.  If ess-sas-submit-method is 'sh, then the message buffer
will display the shell notification when the job is complete.  The 'sh
setting also allows you to terminate the SAS batch job before it is
finished.
     F8 (F3)
   Terminating a SAS batch in the *shell* buffer.
     kill %1
   You may want to visit the .log (whether the job is still running or
it is finished) and check for error messages.  The .log will be
refreshed and you will be placed in it's buffer.  You will be taken to
the 1st error message, if any.
     F5 (F6)
   Goto the next error message, if any.
     F5 (F6)
   Now, refresh the .lst and go to it's buffer.

   If you wish to make changes, go to the .sas file with.
     F4 (F5)
   Make your editing changes and submit again.

4.5 ESS[SAS]-Function keys for batch processing
===============================================

The setup of function keys for SAS batch processing is unavoidably
complex, but the usage of function keys is simple.  There are five
distinct options:

   Option 1 (default).  Function keys in ESS[SAS] are not bound to elisp
commands.  This is in accordance with the GNU Elisp Coding Standards
(GECS) which do not allow function keys to be bound so that they are
available to the user.

   Options 2-5.  Since GECS does not allow function keys to be bound by
modes, these keys are often unused.  So, ESS[SAS] provides users with
the option of binding elisp commands to these keys.  Users who are
familiar with SAS will, most likely, want to duplicate the function key
capabilities of the SAS Display Manager.  There are four options (noted
in parentheses).

  a. SAS Display Manager has different function key definitions for
     Unix (2, 4) and Windows (3, 5); ESS can use either.

  b. The ESS[SAS] function key definitions can be active in all buffers
     (global: 4, 5) or limited (local: 2, 3) only to buffers with files
     that are associated with ESS[SAS] as specified in your
     auto-mode-alist.

   The distinction between local and global is subtle.  If you want the
ESS[SAS] definitions to work when you are in the *shell* buffer or when
editing files other than the file extensions that ESS[SAS] recognizes,
you will most likely want to use the global definitions.  If you want
your function keys to understand SAS batch commands when you are editing
SAS files, and to behave normally when editing other files, then you
will choose the local definitions.  The option can be chosen by the
person installing ESS for a site or by an individual.

  a. For a site installation or an individual, uncomment ONLY ONE of the
     following lines in your ess-site.el.  ESS[SAS] Function keys are
     available in ESS[SAS] if you uncomment either 2 or 3 and in all
     modes if you uncomment 4 or 5:
          ;;2; (setq ess-sas-local-unix-keys t)
          ;;3; (setq ess-sas-local-pc-keys t)
          ;;4; (setq ess-sas-global-unix-keys t)
          ;;5; (setq ess-sas-global-pc-keys t)

     The names -unix- and -pc- have nothing to do with the operating
     system that you are running.  Rather, they mimic the definitions
     that the SAS Display Manager uses by default on those platforms.

  b. If your site installation has configured the keys contrary to your
     liking, then you must call the appropriate function.
           (load "ess-site") ;; local-unix-keys
           (ess-sas-global-pc-keys)

   Finally, we get to what the function keys actually do.  You may
recognize some of the nicknames as SAS Display Manager commands (they
are in all capitals).

     C-F10 C-F10 kill-em-all
                         kill all buffers associated with a .sas program

   SUBMIT, PROGRAM, LOG and OUTPUT need no further explanation since
they mimic the SAS Display Manager function key definitions.  However,
six other keys have been provided for convenience and are described
below.

   `shell' switches you to the *shell* buffer where you can interact
with your operating system.  This is especially helpful if you would
like to kill a SAS batch job.  You can specify a different buffer name
to associate with a SAS batch job (besides *shell*) with the
buffer-local variable ess-sas-shell-buffer.  This allows you to have
multiple buffers running SAS batch jobs on multiple local/remote
computers that may rely on different methods specified by the
buffer-local variable ess-sas-submit-method.

   F2 performs the `refresh' operation on the current buffer.  `refresh'
compares the buffer's last modified date/time with the file's last
modified date/time and replaces the buffer with the file if the file is
newer.  This is the same operation that is automatically performed when
LOG, OUTPUT, `filetype-1' or F11 are pressed.

   `filetype-1' switches you to a file with the same file name as your
.sas file, but with a different extension (.txt by default) and performs
`refresh'.  You can over-ride the default extension; for example in your
.emacs file:
     (setq ess-sas-suffix-1 "csv") ; for example

   F9 will prompt you for the name of a permanent SAS dataset near
point to be opened for viewing by PROC FSEDIT.  You can control the SAS
batch command-line with ess-sas-data-view-submit-options.  For
controlling the SAS batch commands, you have the global variables
ess-sas-data-view-libname and ess-sas-data-view-fsview-command as well
as the buffer-local variable ess-sas-data-view-fsview-statement.  If you
have your SAS LIBNAMEs defined in autoexec.sas, then the defaults for
these variables should be sufficient.

   Similarly, C-F9 will prompt you for the name of a permanent SAS
dataset near point to be opened for viewing by PROC INSIGHT.  You can
control the SAS batch command-line with
ess-sas-data-view-submit-options.  For controlling the SAS batch
commands, you have the global variables ess-sas-data-view-libname and
ess-sas-data-view-insight-command as well as the buffer-local variable
ess-sas-data-view-insight-statement.

   F10 toggles ESS[SAS] mode for .log files which is off by default
(technically, it is SAS-log-mode, but it looks the same).  The syntax
highlighting can be helpful in certain debugging situations, but large
.log files may take a long time to highlight.

   F11 is the same as `filetype-1' except it is .dat by default.

   F12 will prompt you for the name of a GSASFILE near the point in
.log to be opened for viewing either with emacs or with an external
viewer.  Depending on your version of emacs and the operating system
you are using, emacs may support .gif and .jpg files internally.  You
may need to change the following variables for your own situation.
ess-sas-graph-view-suffix-regexp is a regular expression of supported
file types defined via file name extensions.
ess-sas-graph-view-viewer-default is the default external viewer for
your platform.  ess-sas-graph-view-viewer-alist is an alist of
exceptions to the default; i.e. file types and their associated viewers
which will be used rather than the default viewer.
     (setq ess-sas-graph-view-suffix-regexp (concat "[.]\\([eE]?[pP][sS]\\|"
     "[pP][dD][fF]\\|[gG][iI][fF]\\|[jJ][pP][eE]?[gG]\\|"
     "[tT][iI][fF][fF]?\\)")) ;; default
     (setq ess-sas-graph-view-viewer-default "kodakimg") ;; Windows default
     (setq ess-sas-graph-view-viewer-default "sdtimage") ;; Solaris default
     (setq ess-sas-graph-view-viewer-alist
       '(("[eE]?[pP][sS]" . "gv") ("[pP][dD][fF]" . "acroread")) ;; default

   C-F2 produces US landscape by default, however, it can produce A4
landscape (first line for "global" key mapping, second for "local"):
     (global-set-key [(control f2)] 'ess-sas-rtf-a4-landscape)
     (define-key sas-mode-local-map [(control f2)] 'ess-sas-rtf-a4-landscape)

4.6 iESS[SAS]-Interactive SAS processes
=======================================

iESS (inferior ESS) is the method for interfacing with interactive
statistical processes (programs).  iESS[SAS] is what is needed for
interactive SAS programming.  iESS[SAS] works best with the following
settings for SAS command-line options (the default of
inferior-SAS-args):

     -stdio -linesize 80 -noovp -nosyntaxcheck

     -stdio
                 required to make the redirection of stdio work
     -linesize 80
                 keeps output lines from folding on standard terminals
     -noovp
                 prevents error messages from printing 3 times
     -nosyntaxcheck
                 permits recovery after syntax errors

   To start up iESS[SAS] mode, use:
        M-x SAS

   The *SAS:1.log* buffer in ESStr mode corresponds to the file
myfile.log in SAS batch usage and to the "SAS: LOG" window in the SAS
Display Manager.  All commands submitted to SAS, informative messages,
warnings, and errors appear here.

   The *SAS:1.lst* buffer in ESSlst mode corresponds to the file
myfile.lst in SAS batch usage and to the "SAS: OUTPUT" window in the
SAS Display Manager.  All data related printed output from the PROCs
appear in this window.

   The iESS [SAS:1] buffer exists solely as a communications buffer.
Files are edited in the myfile.sas buffer.  The C-c C-r key in ESS[SAS]
is the functional equivalent of bringing a file into the "SAS: PROGRAM
EDITOR" window followed by the 'Local' 'Submit' menu commands.  The
user should never use this buffer directly.

   For example, open the file you want to work with.
     C-x C-f myfile.sas
   myfile.sas will be in ESS[SAS] mode.  Edit as appropriate, and then
start up SAS with the cursor in the myfile.sas buffer.
     M-x SAS
   Four buffers will appear on screen:
     Buffer          Mode            Description
     myfile.sas      ESS[SAS]        your source file
     *SAS:1*         iESS [SAS:1]    ESS communication buffer
     *SAS:1.log*     Shell [] ESStr  SAS log information
     *SAS:1.lst*     Shell [] ESSlst SAS listing information
   If you would prefer each of the four buffers to appear in its own
individual frame, you can arrange for that.  Place the cursor in the
buffer displaying myfile.sas.  Enter the sequence:
     C-c C-w
   The cursor will normally be in buffer myfile.sas.  If not, put it
there:
     C-x b myfile.sas
   Send regions, lines, or the entire file contents to SAS (regions are
most useful).  A highlighted region will normally begin with the
keywords 'DATA' or 'PROC' and end with the keyword 'RUN;'
     C-c C-r
   Information appears in the log buffer, analysis results in the
listing buffer.  In case of errors, make the corrections in the
myfile.sas buffer and resubmit with another C-c C-r

   At the end of the session you may save the log and listing buffers
with the usual C-x C-s commands.  You will be prompted for a file name.
Typically, the names myfile.log and myfile.lst will be used.  You will
almost certainly want to edit the saved files before including them in
a report.  The files are read-only by default.  You can make them
writable by the emacs command C-x C-q.

   At the end of the session, the input file myfile.sas will typically
have been revised.  You can save it.  It can be used later as the
beginning of another iESS[SAS] session.  It can also be used as a batch
input file to SAS.

   The *SAS:1* buffer is strictly for ESS use.  The user should never
need to read it or write to it.  Refer to the .lst and .log buffers for
monitoring output!

4.7 iESS[SAS]-Common problems
=============================

     1. iESS[SAS] does not work on Windows.  In order to run SAS inside
        an emacs buffer, it is necessary to start SAS with the -stdio option.
        SAS does not support the -stdio option on Windows.

     2. If M-x SAS gives errors upon startup, check the following:
        - you are running Windows:  see 1.
        - ess-sas-sh-command (in the ESS source directory) needs to be
          executable (solution: "chmod ugo+rx ess-sas-sh-command").
        - sas isn't in your executable path (verify using "which sas" from
          a shell command-line)

     3. M-x SAS starts SAS Display Manager.  Probably, the command "sas"
        on your system calls a shell script.  Specify the path to the real
        "sas" executable in the file ess-sas-sh-command, i.e.:
          /usr/local/sas612/sas </dev/tty 1>$stdout 2>$stderr $@
        To find the "sas" exectuable, you can execute the unix command:
          find / -name sas -print

4.8 ESS[SAS]-Graphics
=====================

Output from GPROCs can be displayed in a SAS/Graph window for SAS batch
on Windows or for both SAS batch and interactive with X11 on Unix.  If
you need to create graphics files and view them with F12, then include
the following (either in myfile.sas or in your autoexec.sas):
     filename gsasfile 'graphics.ps';
     goptions device=ps gsfname=gsasfile gsfmode=append;
   PROC PLOT graphs can be viewed in the listing buffer.  You may wish
to control the vertical spacing to allow the entire plot to be visible
on screen, for example:
     proc plot;
         plot a*b / vpos=25;
     run;

4.9 ESS[SAS]-MS Windows
=======================

   * iESS[SAS] does not work on Windows.  *Note iESS(SAS)--Common
     problems::.

   * ESS[SAS] mode for editing SAS language files works very well.
     *Note ESS(SAS)--Editing files::.

   * There are two execution options for SAS on Windows.  You can use
     batch.  *Note ESS(SAS)--Batch SAS processes::.

     Or you can mark regions with the mouse and submit the code with
     `submit-region' or paste them into SAS Display Manager.

5 Help for BUGS
***************

* Menu:

* ESS(BUGS)--Model files::
* ESS(BUGS)--Command files::
* ESS(BUGS)--Log files::

   ESS[BUGS] was designed for use with BUGS software.  It was developed
by Rodney A. Sparapani and has some similarities with ESS[SAS].  ESS
facilitates BUGS batch with ESS[BUGS], the mode for files with the .bug
extension.  ESS provides 5 features.  First, BUGS syntax is described
to allow for proper fontification of statements, distributions,
functions, commands and comments in BUGS model files, command files and
log files.  Second, ESS creates templates for the command file from the
model file so that a BUGS batch process can be defined by a single
file.  Third, ESS provides a BUGS batch script that allows ESS to set
BUGS batch parameters.  Fourth, key sequences are defined to create a
command file and submit a BUGS batch process.  Lastly, interactive
submission of BUGS commands is also supported.


File: ess.info,  Node: ESS(BUGS)--Model files,  Next: ESS(BUGS)--Command files,  Prev: Help for BUGS,  Up: Help for BUGS

5.1 ESS[BUGS]-Model files
=========================

Model files (with the .bug extension) are edited in ESS[BUGS] mode.
Two keys are bound for your use in ESS[BUGS], F2 and F12.  F2 performs
the same action as it does in ESS[SAS], *Note ESS(SAS)--Function keys
for batch processing::.  F12 performs the function ess-bugs-next-action
which you will use a lot.  Pressing F12 in an empty buffer for a model
file will produce a template for you.

   ESS[BUGS] supports "replacement" variables.  These variables are
created as part of the template, i.e. with the first press of F12 in an
empty buffer.  They are named by all capitals and start with '%':  %N,
%DATA, %INIT, %MONITOR and %STATS.  When you are finished editing your
model file, pressing F12 will perform the necessary replacements and
build your command file for you.

   The %DATA variable appears in the line 'data  in "%DATA";'.  On the
second press of F12, %DATA will be replaced by the model file name
except it will have the .dat extension.  If your data file is named
something else, then change %DATA in the template to the appropriate
file name and no replacement will occur.

   The %INIT variable appears in the line 'inits in "%INIT";'.  On the
second press of F12, %INIT will be replaced by the model file name
except it will have the .in extension.  If your model will be
generating it's own initial values, place a comment character, #, at
the beginning of the line.  Or, if your init file is named something
else, then change %INIT in the template to the appropriate file name.

   The %N variable appears in the line 'const N = 0;#%N'.  Although it
is commented, it is still active.  Notice that later on in the template
you have the line 'for (i in 1:N)'.  The BUGS constant N is the number
of rows in your data file.  When you press F12, the data file is read
and the number of lines are counted (after %DATA is resolved, if
necessary).  The number of lines replace the zero in the 'const N = 0'
statement.

   The %MONITOR variable appears on a line by itself.  Although it is
commented, it is still active.  This line is a list of variables that
you want monitored.  When you press F12, the appropriate statements are
created in the command file to monitor the list of variables.  If the
line is blank, then the list is populated with the variables from the
'var' statement.

   The %STATS variable is similar to the %MONITOR variable.  It is a
list of variables for which summary statistics will be calculated.
When you press F12, the appropriate statements will be generated in
your command file.

   Please note that the %DATA and %INIT variables are only replaced on
the second press of F12, but the actions for %N, %MONITOR and %STATS
are performed on each press of F12 if you re-visit the model file.

5.2 ESS[BUGS]-Command files
===========================

To avoid extension name collision, .bmd is used for BUGS command files.
When you have finished editing your model file and press F12, a
command file is created if one does not already exist.  However, the
command file was created, it recognizes two "replacement" variables:
%MONITOR and %STATS.

   Two %MONITOR variables appears on lines by themselves.  Although
they are commented, they are still active.  Between them appears the
necessary statements to monitor the list of variables specified in the
model file.  The behavior of the %STATS variable is similar.

   When you are finished editing your command file, pressing F12 again
will submit your command file as a batch job.  Batch scripts are
provided for both DOS and Unix in the etc sub-directory of the ESS
distribution.  The DOS script is called "BACKBUGS.BAT" and the Unix
script is "backbugs".  These scripts allow you to change the number of
bins to use in the Griddy algorithm (Metropolis sampling).  That is
handled by the variable ess-bugs-default-bins which defaults to 32.

5.3 ESS[BUGS]-Log files
=======================

To avoid extension name collision, .bog is used for BUGS log files.
The BUGS batch script provided with ESS creates the .bog file from the
.log file when the batch process completes.  If you need to look at the
.log file while the batch process is running, it will not appear in
ESS[BUGS] mode unless you modify the auto-mode-alist variable.  If you
have done so, then you may find F2 useful to refresh the .log if the
batch process over-writes or appends it.

6 Interacting with the ESS process
**********************************

The primary function of the ESS package is to provide an easy-to-use
front end to the S interpreter.  This is achieved by running the S
process from within an Emacs buffer, so that the Emacs editing commands
are available to correct mistakes in commands, etc.  The features of
Inferior S mode are similar to those provided by the standard Emacs
shell mode (*note Shell Mode: (emacs)Shell Mode.).  Command-line
completion of S objects and a number of `hot keys' for commonly-used S
commands are also provided for ease of typing.

6.1 Entering commands and fixing mistakes
=========================================

Sending a command to the ESS process is as simple as typing it in and
pressing the <RETURN> key:

   * `RET' (`inferior-ess-send-input')
     Send the command on the current line to the ESS process.

   If you make a typing error before pressing `RET' all the usual Emacs
editing commands are available to correct it (*note Basic:
(emacs)Basic.).  Once the command has been corrected you can press
<RETURN> (even if the cursor is not at the end of the line) to send the
corrected command to the ESS process.

   ESS provides some other commands which are useful for fixing
mistakes:

   * `C-c C-w' (`backward-kill-word')
     Deletes the previous word (such as an object name) on the command
     line.

   * `C-c C-u' (`comint-kill-input')
     Deletes everything from the prompt to point.  Use this to abandon a
     command you have not yet sent to the ESS process.

   * `C-c C-a' (`comint-bol')
     Move to the beginning of the line, and then skip forwards past the
     prompt, if any.

   *Note Shell Mode: (emacs)Shell Mode, for other commands relevant to
entering input.


File: ess.info,  Node: Completion,  Next: Completion details,  Prev: Command-line editing,  Up: Entering commands

6.2 Completion of object names
==============================

In the process buffer, the <TAB> key is for completion, similar to that
provided by Shell Mode for filenames.  In Inferior S mode, pressing the
<TAB> key when the cursor is following the first few characters of an
object name _completes_ the object name; if the cursor is following a
file name `TAB' completes the file name.

   * `TAB' (`comint-dynamic-complete')
     Complete the S object name or filename before point.

   When the cursor is just after a partially-completed object name,
pressing <TAB> provides completion in a similar fashion to `tcsh' except
that completion is performed over all known S object names instead of
file names.  ESS maintains a list of all objects known to S at any
given time, which basically consists of all objects (functions and
datasets) in every attached directory listed by the `search()' command along
with the component objects of attached data frames (if your version of
S supports them).

   For example, consider the three functions (available in Splus version
3.0) called `binomplot()', `binom.test()' and `binomial()'.  Typing
`bin TAB' after the S prompt will insert the characters `om',
completing the longest prefix (`binom') which distinguishes these three
commands.  Pressing `TAB' once more provides a list of the three
commands which have this prefix, allowing you to add more characters
(say, `.') which specify the function you desire.  After entering more
characters pressing `TAB' yet again will complete the object name up to
uniqueness, etc.  If you just wish to see what completions exist without
adding any extra characters, type `M-?'.

   * `M-?' (`ess-list-object-completions')
     List all possible completions of the object name at point.

   ESS also provides completion over the components of named lists
accessed using the `$' notation, to any level of nested lists.  This
feature is particularly useful for checking what components of a list
object exist while partway through entering a command: simply type the
object name and `$' and press `TAB' to see the names of existing list
components for that object.  

   Completion is also provided over file names, which is particularly
useful when using S functions such as `get()' or `scan()' which require
fully expanded file names.  Whenever the cursor is within an S string,
pressing `TAB' completes the file name before point, and also expands
any `~' or environment variable references.

   If the cursor is not in a string and does not follow a (partial)
object name, the <TAB> key has a third use: it expands history
references.  *Note History expansion::.

6.3 Completion details
======================

ESS automatically keeps track of any objects added or deleted to the
system (such as new objects created, or directories added to the search
list) to make completion as accurate as possible.  Whenever ESS notices
that search list has changed (1)  when you attach a directory or data
frame, the objects associated with it immediately become available for a
completion; when it is detached completion is no longer available on
those objects.

   To maintain a list of accessible objects for completion, ESS needs to
determine which objects are contained in each directory or data frame on
the search list.  This is done at the start of each S session, by
running the `objects()' command on every element of the search list.
On some systems, however, this can be rather slow; it's doubly
frustrating when you consider that most of the directories on the search
list are the standard S libraries, which never change anyway!  When ESS
was installed, a database of the standard object names should have been
created which should speed up this process at the start of an S
session; if it has not been created you will get a warning like
`S-namedb.el does not exist'.  *Note Installation::, for information on
how to create this database.

   Efficiency in completion is gained by maintaining a cache of objects
currently known to S; when a new object becomes available or is deleted,
only one component of the cache corresponding to the associated
directory needs to be refreshed.  If ESS ever becomes confused about
what objects are available for completion (such as when if refuses to
complete an object you *know* is there), the command `M-x ess-resynch' forces
the _entire_ cache to be refreshed, which should fix the problem.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The variable `ess-change-sp-regexp' is a regular expression
matching commands which change the search list.  You will need to
modify this variable if you have defined custom commands (other than
`attach', `detach', `collection' or `library') which modify the search
list.

6.4 Manipulating the transcript
===============================

Most of the time, the cursor spends most of its time at the bottom of
the ESS process buffer, entering commands.  However all the input and
output from the current (and previous) ESS sessions is stored in the
process buffer (we call this the transcript) and often we want to move
back up through the buffer, to look at the output from previous
commands for example.

   Within the process buffer, a paragraph is defined as the prompt, the
command after the prompt, and the output from the command.  Thus `M-{'
and `M-}' move you backwards and forwards, respectively, through
commands in the transcript.  A particularly useful command is `M-h'
(`mark-paragraph') which will allow you to mark a command and its
entire output (for deletion, perhaps).  For more information about
paragraph commands, *note Paragraphs: (emacs)Paragraphs.

   If an ESS process finishes and you restart it in the same process
buffer, the output from the new ESS process appears after the output
from the first ESS process separated by a form-feed (`^L') character.
Thus pages in the ESS process buffer correspond to ESS sessions.  Thus,
for example, you may use `C-x [' and `C-x ]' to move backward and
forwards through ESS sessions in a single ESS process buffer.  For more
information about page commands, *note Pages: (emacs)Pages.

6.4.1 Manipulating the output from the last command
---------------------------------------------------

Viewing the output of the command you have just entered is a common
occurrence and ESS provides a number of facilities for doing this.
Whenever a command produces a longish output, it is possible that the
window will scroll, leaving the next prompt near the middle of the
window.  The first part of the command output may have scrolled off the
top of the window, even though the entire output would fit in the window
if the prompt were near the bottom of the window.  If this happens, you
can use the command

   * `C-c C-e' (`comint-show-maximum-output')
     Move to the end of the buffer, and place cursor on bottom line of
     window.

to make more of the last output visible.  (To make this happen
automatically for all inputs, set the variable
`comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-input' to `t'; for information on this and
other options for handling process input and output *note Shell Mode
Options: (emacs)Shell Options.)

   If the first part of the output is still obscured, use 
   * `C-c C-r' (`comint-show-output')
     Moves cursor to the previous command line and and places it at the
     top of the window.

to view it.  Finally, if you want to discard the last command output
altogether, use

   * `C-c C-o' (`comint-kill-output')
     Deletes everything from the last command to the current prompt.

to delete it.  Use this command judiciously to keep your transcript to a
more manageable size.


File: ess.info,  Node: Process buffer motion,  Next: Transcript resubmit,  Prev: Last command,  Up: Transcript

6.4.2 Viewing older commands
----------------------------

If you want to view the output from more historic commands than the
previous command, commands are also provided to move backwards and
forwards through previously entered commands in the process buffer:

   * `C-c C-p' (`comint-previous-input')
     Moves point to the preceding command in the process buffer.

   * `C-c C-n' (`comint-next-input')
     Moves point to the next command in the process buffer.

Note that these two commands are analogous to `C-p' and `C-n' but apply
to command lines rather than text lines.  And just like `C-p' and
`C-n', passing a prefix argument to these commands means to move to the
ARG'th next (or previous) command.  (These commands are also discussed
in *Note Shell History Copying: (emacs)Shell History Copying.)

   There are also two similar commands (not bound to any keys by
default) which move to preceding or succeeding commands, but which
first prompt for a regular expression (*note Syntax of Regular
Expression: (emacs)Regexps.), and then moves to the next (previous)
command matching the pattern.

   * `(comint-backward-matching-input regexp arg)'
     `(comint-forward-matching-input regexp arg)'
     Search backward (forward) through the transcript buffer for the
     ARG'th previous (next) command matching REGEXP.  ARG is the prefix
     argument; REGEXP is prompted for in the minibuffer.


File: ess.info,  Node: Transcript resubmit,  Next: Saving transcripts,  Prev: Process buffer motion,  Up: Transcript

6.4.3 Re-submitting commands from the transcript
------------------------------------------------

When moving through the transcript, you may wish to re-execute some of
the commands you find there.  ESS provides three commands to do this;
these commands may be used whenever the cursor is within a command line
in the transcript (if the cursor is within some command _output_, an
error is signaled).  Note all three commands involve the <RETURN> key.

   * `RET' (`inferior-ess-send-input')
     Copy the command under the cursor to the current command line, and
     execute it.

   * `C-c RET' (`comint-copy-old-input')
     Copy the command under the cursor to the current command line, but
     don't execute it.  Leaves the cursor on the command line so that
     the copied command may be edited.

   * `M-RET' (`ess-transcript-send-command-and-move')
     Copy the command under the cursor to the current command line, and
     execute it.  Moves the cursor to the following command.

   When the cursor is not after the current prompt, the <RETURN> key
has a slightly different behavior than usual.  Pressing `RET' on any
line containing a command that you entered (i.e. a line beginning with a
prompt) sends that command to the ESS process once again.  If you wish
to edit the command before executing it, use `C-c RET' instead; it
copies the command to the current prompt but does not execute it,
allowing you to edit it before submitting it.

   These two commands leave the cursor at the new command line, allowing
you to continue with interactive use of S.  If you wish to resubmit a
series of commands from the transcript, consider using `M-RET' instead,
which leaves the cursor at the command line following the one you
re-submitted.  Thus by using `M-RET' repeatedly, you can re-submit a
whole series of commands.

   These commands work even if if the current line is a continuation
line (i.e. the prompt is `+' instead of `>') -- in this case all the
lines that form the multi-line command are concatenated together and
the resulting command is sent to the ESS process (currently this is the
only way to resubmit a multi-line command to the ESS process in one
go).  If the current line does not begin with a prompt, an error is
signaled.  This feature, coupled with the command-based motion commands
described above, could be used as a primitive history mechanism.  ESS
provides a more sophisticated mechanism, however, which is described in
*Note Command History::.

6.4.4 Keeping a record of your S session
----------------------------------------

To keep a record of your S session in a disk file, use the Emacs
command `C-x C-w' (`write-file') to attach a file to the ESS process
buffer.  The name of the process buffer will (probably) change to the
name of the file, but this is not a problem.  You can still use S as
usual; just remember to save the file before you quit Emacs with `C-x
C-s'.  You can make ESS prompt you for a filename in which to save the
transcript every time you start S by setting the variable `ess-ask-about-transfile'
to `t'; see *Note Customizing startup::.  We recommend you save your
transcripts with filenames that end in `.St'.  There is a special mode
(ESS transcript mode -- *note Transcript Mode::) for editing transcript
files which is automatically selected for files with this suffix.

   S transcripts can get very large, so some judicious editing is
appropriate if you are saving it in a file.  Use `C-c C-o' whenever a
command produces excessively long output (printing large arrays, for
example).  Delete erroneous commands (and the resulting error messages
or other output) by moving to the command (or its output) and typing
`M-h C-w'.  Also, remember that `C-c C-e' (and other hot keys) may be
used for commands whose output you do not wish to appear in the
transcript.  These suggestions are appropriate even if you are not
saving your transcript to disk, since the larger the transcript, the
more memory your Emacs process will use on the host machine.

   Finally, if you intend to produce S source code (suitable for using
with `source()' or inclusion in an S function) from a transcript, then
the command `M-x ess-transcript-clean-region' may be of use.  This
command works in any Emacs buffer, and removes all prompts and command
output from an ESS transcript within the current region, leaving only
the commands.  Don't forget to remove any erroneous commands first!


File: ess.info,  Node: Command History,  Next: History expansion,  Prev: Transcript,  Up: Entering commands

6.5 Command History
===================

ESS provides easy-to-use facilities for re-executing or editing previous
commands.  An input history of the last few commands is maintained (by
default the last 50 commands are stored, although this can be changed by
setting the variable `comint-input-ring-size' in `inferior-ess-mode-hook'.)
The simplest history commands simply select the next and previous
commands in the input history:

   * `M-p' (`comint-previous-input')
     Select the previous command in the input history.

   * `M-n'  (`comint-next-input')
     Select the next command in the input history.

For example, pressing `M-p' once will re-enter the last command into
the process buffer after the prompt but does not send it to the ESS
process, thus allowing editing or correction of the command before the
ESS process sees it.  Once corrections have been made, press `RET' to
send the edited command to the ESS process.

   If you want to select a particular command from the history by
matching it against a regular expression (*note Syntax of Regular
Expression: (emacs)Regexps.), to search for a particular variable name
for example, these commands are also available:

   * `M-r' (`comint-previous-matching-input')
     Prompt for a regular expression, and search backwards through the
     input history for a command matching the expression.

   * `M-s' (`comint-next-matching-input')
     Prompt for a regular expression, and search backwards through the
     input history for a command matching the expression.

A common type of search is to find the last command that began with a
particular sequence of characters; the following two commands provide an
easy way to do this:

   * `A-M-r' (`comint-previous-matching-input-from-input')
     Select the previous command in the history which matches the string
     typed so far.

   * `A-M-s' (`comint-next-matching-input-from-input')
     Select the next command in the history which matches the string
     typed so far.

Instead of prompting for a regular expression to match against, as they
instead select commands starting with those characters already entered.
For instance, if you wanted to re-execute the last `attach()' command,
you may only need to type `att' and then `A-M-r' and `RET'.  (Note: you
may not have an <ALT> key on your keyboard, in which case it may be a
good idea to bind these commands to some other keys.)

   *Note Shell History Ring: (emacs)Shell Ring, for a more detailed
discussion of the history mechanism.

6.6 References to historical commands
=====================================

Instead of searching through the command history using the command
described in the previous section, you can alternatively refer to a
historical command directly using a notation very similar to that used
in `csh'.  History references are introduced by a `!' or `^' character
and have meanings as follows:

`!!'
     The immediately previous command

`!-N'
     The Nth previous command

`!text'
     The last command beginning with the string `text'

`!?text'
     The last command containing the string `text'

   In addition, you may follow the reference with a "word designator"
to select particular "words" of the input.  A word is defined as a
sequence of characters separated by whitespace.  (You can modify this
definition by setting the value of `comint-delimiter-argument-list' to
a list of characters that are allowed to separate words and themselves
form words.)  Words are numbered beginning with zero.  The word
designator usually begins with a `:' (colon) character; however it may
be omitted if the word reference begins with a `^', `$', `*' or `-'.
If the word is to be selected from the previous command, the second `!'
character can be omitted from the event specification.  For instance,
`!!:1' and `!:1' both refer to the first word of the previous command,
while `!!$' and `!$' both refer to the last word in the previous
command.  The format of word designators is as follows:

`0'
     The zeroth word (i.e. the first one on the command line)

`N'
     The Nth word, where N is a number

`^'
     The first word (i.e. the second one on the command line)

`$'
     The last word

`X-Y'
     A range of words; `-Y' abbreviates `0-Y'

`*'
     All the words except the zeroth word, or nothing if the command
     had just one word (the zeroth)

`X*'
     Abbreviates X-$

`X-'
     Like `X*', but omitting the last word

   In addition, you may surround the entire reference except for the
first `!' by braces to allow it to be followed by other (non-whitespace)
characters (which will be appended to the expanded reference).

   Finally, ESS also provides quick substitution; a reference like
`^old^new^' means "the last command, but with the first occurrence of
the string `old' replaced with the string `new'" (the last `^' is
optional).  Similarly, `^old^' means "the last command, with the first
occurrence of the string `old' deleted" (again, the last `^' is
optional).

   To convert a history reference as described above to an input
suitable for S, you need to "expand" the history reference, using the
<TAB> key.  For this to work, the cursor must be preceded by a space
(otherwise it would try to complete an object name) and not be within a
string (otherwise it would try to complete a filename).  So to expand
the history reference, type `SPC TAB'.  This will convert the history
reference into an S command from the history, which you can then edit
or press <RET> to execute.

   For example, to execute the last command that referenced the variable
`data', type `!?data SPC TAB RET'.

6.7 Hot keys for common commands
================================

ESS provides a number of commands for executing the commonly used
functions.  These commands below are basically information-gaining
commands (such as `objects()' or `search()') which tend to clutter up
your transcript and for this reason some of the hot keys display their
output in a temporary buffer instead of the process buffer by default.
This behavior is controlled by the variable
`ess-execute-in-process-buffer' which, if non-`nil', means that these
commands will produce their output in the process buffer instead.  In
any case, passing a prefix argument to the commands (with `C-u') will
reverse the meaning of `ess-execute-in-process-buffer' for that
command, i.e. the output will be displayed in the process buffer if it
usually goes to a temporary buffer, and vice-versa.  These are the hot
keys that behave in this way:

   * `C-c C-x' (`ess-execute-objects')
     Sends the `objects()' command to the ESS process.  A prefix
     argument specifies the position on the search list (use a negative
     argument to toggle `es-execute-in-process-buffer' as well).  A
     quick way to see what objects are in your working directory.  

   * `C-c C-s' (`ess-execute-search')
     Sends the `search()' command to the ESS process.  

   * `C-c C-e' (`ess-execute')
     Prompt for an ESS expression, and evaluate it.

   `ess-execute' may seem pointless when you could just type the
command in anyway, but it proves useful for `spot' calculations which
would otherwise clutter your transcript, or for evaluating an expression
while partway through entering a command.  You can also use this command
to generate new hot keys using the Emacs keyboard macro facilities;
*note Keyboard Macros: (emacs)Keyboard Macros.  

   The following hot keys do not use `ess-execute-in-process-buffer' to
decide where to display the output -- they either always display in the
process buffer or in a separate buffer, as indicated:

   * `C-c C-a' (`ess-execute-attach')
     Prompts for a directory to attach to the ESS process with the
     `attach()' command.  If a numeric prefix argument is given it is
     used as the position on the search list to attach the directory;
     otherwise the S default of 2 is used.  The `attach()' command
     actually executed appears in the process buffer.

   * `C-c C-l' (`ess-load-file')
     Prompts for a file to load into the ESS process using `source()'.
     If there is an error during loading, you can jump to the error in
     the file with `C-x `' (`ess-parse-errors').  *Note Error
     Checking::, for more details.

   * `C-c C-v' (`ess-display-help-on-object')
     Pops up a help buffer for an S object or function.  See *Note
     Help:: for more details.

   * `C-c C-q' (`ess-quit')
     Sends the `q()' command to the ESS process (or `(exit)' to the XLS
     process), and cleans up any temporary buffers (such as help
     buffers or edit buffers) you may have created along the way.  Use
     this command when you have finished your S session instead of
     simply typing `q()' yourself, otherwise you will need to issue the
     command `M-x ess-cleanup' command explicitly to make sure that all
     the files that need to be saved have been saved, and that all the
     temporary buffers have been killed.

6.8 Is the Statistical Process running under ESS?
=================================================

For the S languages (S, S-Plus, R) ESS sets an option in the current
process that programs in the language can check to determine the
environment in which they are currently running.

   ESS sets `options(STERM="iESS")' for S language processes running in
an inferior `iESS[S]' or `iESS[R]' buffer.

   ESS sets `options(STERM="ddeESS")' for independent S-Plus for Windows
processes running in the GUI and communicating with ESS via the DDE
(Microsoft Dynamic Data Exchange) protocol through a `ddeESS[S]' buffer.

   Other values of `options()$STERM' that we recommend are:

   * `length':     Fixed length xterm or telnet window.

   * `scrollable': Unlimited length xterm or telnet window.

   * `server':     S-Plus Stat Server.

   * `BATCH':      BATCH.

   * `Rgui':       R GUI.

   * `Commands':   S-Plus GUI without DDE interface to ESS.

   Additional values may be recommended in the future as new interaction
protocols are created.  Unlike the values `iESS' and `ddeESS', ESS
can't set these other values since the S language program is not under
the control of ESS.


File: ess.info,  Node: Emacsclient,  Next: Other,  Prev: Statistical Process running in ESS?,  Up: Entering commands

6.9 Using emacsclient
=====================

When starting R or S under Unix, ESS sets
`options(editor="emacsclient")'.  (Under Microsoft Windows, it will use
gnuclient.exe rather than emacsclient, but the same principle applies.)
Within your R session, for example, if you have a function called
`iterator', typing `fix(iterator)', will show that function in a
temporary Emacs buffer.  You can then correct the function.  When you
kill the buffer, the definition of the function is updated.  Using
`edit()' rather than `fix()' means that the function is not updated.
Finally, the S function `page(x)' will also show a text representation
of the object `x' in a temporary Emacs buffer.


File: ess.info,  Node: Other,  Prev: Emacsclient,  Up: Entering commands

6.10 Other commands provided by inferior-ESS
============================================

The following commands are also provided in the process buffer:

   * `C-c C-c' (`comint-interrupt-subjob')
     Sends a Control-C signal to the ESS process.  This has the effect
     of aborting the current command.

   * `C-c C-z' (`ess-abort')
     Sends a STOP signal to the ESS process, killing it immediately.
     It's not a good idea to use this, in general: Neither `q()' nor
     `.Last' will be executed and device drivers will not finish
     cleanly.  This command is provided as a safety to
     `comint-stop-subjob', which is usually bound to `C-c C-z'.  If you
     want to quit from S, use `C-c C-q' (`ess-quit') instead.  

   * `C-c C-d' (`ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer')
     Prompts for an object to be edited in an edit buffer.  *Note
     Editing::.

   Other commands available in Inferior S mode are discussed in *Note
Shell Mode: (emacs)Shell Mode.

7 Editing S functions
*********************

ESS provides facilities for editing S objects within your Emacs
session.  Most editing is performed on S functions, although in theory
you may edit datasets as well.  Edit buffers are always associated with
files, although you may choose to make these files temporary if you
wish.  Alternatively, you may make use of a simple yet powerful
mechanism for maintaining backups of text representations of S
functions.  Error-checking is performed when S code is loaded into the
ESS process.

7.1 Creating or modifying S objects
===================================

To edit an S object, type

   * `C-c C-d' (`ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer')
     Edit an S object in its own edit buffer.

   from within the ESS process buffer (`*S*').  You will then be
prompted for an object to edit: you may either type in the name of an
existing object (for which completion is available using the `TAB' key), or
you may enter the name of a new object.  A buffer will be created
containing the text representation of the requested object or, if you
entered the name of a non-existent object at the prompt and the
variable `ess-function-template' is non-`nil', you will be presented
with a template defined by that variable, which defaults to a skeleton
function construct.

   You may then edit the function as required.  The edit buffer
generated by `ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer' is placed in the `ESS'
major mode which provides a number of commands to facilitate editing S
source code.  Commands are provided to intelligently indent S code,
evaluate portions of S code and to move around S code constructs.

   Note: when you dump a file with `C-c C-d', ESS first checks to see
whether there already exists an edit buffer containing that object and,
if so, pops you directly to that buffer.  If not, ESS next checks
whether there is a file in the appropriate place with the appropriate
name (*note Source Files::) and if so, reads in that file.  You can use
this facility to return to an object you were editing in a previous
session (and which possibly was never loaded to the S session).
Finally, if both these tests fail, the ESS process is consulted and a
`dump()' command issued.  If you want to force ESS to ask the ESS
process for the object's definition (say, to reformat an unmodified
buffer or to revert back to S's idea of the object's definition) pass a
prefix argument to `ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer' by typing `C-u
C-c C-d'.

7.2 Loading source files into the ESS process
=============================================

The best way to get information -- particularly function definitions --
into S is to load them in as source file, using S's `source' function.
You have already seen how to create source files using `C-c C-d'; ESS
provides a complementary command for loading source files (even files
not created with ESS!) into the ESS process:

   * `C-c C-l' (`ess-load-file')
     Loads a file into the ESS process using `source()'.  

After typing `C-c C-l' you will prompted for the name of the file to
load into S; usually this is the current buffer's file which is the
default value (selected by simply pressing `RET' at the prompt).  You
will be asked to save the buffer first if it has been modified (this
happens automatically if the buffer was generated with `C-c C-d').  The
file will then be loaded, and if it loads successfully you will be
returned to the ESS process.


File: ess.info,  Node: Error Checking,  Next: Evaluating code,  Prev: Loading,  Up: Editing

7.3 Detecting errors in source files
====================================

If any errors occur when loading a file with `C-c C-l', ESS will inform
you of this fact.  In this case, you can jump directly to the line in
the source file which caused the error by typing `C-x `'
(`ess-parse-errors').  You will be returned to the offending file
(loading it into a buffer if necessary) with point at the line S
reported as containing the error.  You may then correct the error, and
reload the file.  Note that none of the commands in an S source file
will take effect if any part of the file contains errors.

   Sometimes the error is not caused by a syntax error (loading a
non-existent file for example). In this case typing `C-x `' will simply
display a buffer containing S's error message.  You can force this
behavior (and avoid jumping to the file when there _is_ a syntax error)
by passing a prefix argument to `ess-parse-errors' with `C-u C-x `'.


File: ess.info,  Node: Evaluating code,  Next: Indenting,  Prev: Error Checking,  Up: Editing

7.4 Sending code to the ESS process
===================================

Other commands are also available for evaluating portions of code in the
S process.  These commands cause the selected code to be evaluated
directly by the ESS process as if you had typed them in at the command
line; the `source()' function is not used.  You may choose whether both
the commands and their output appear in the process buffer (as if you
had typed in the commands yourself) or if the output alone is echoed.
The behavior is controlled by the variable `ess-eval-visibly-p' whose
default is `nil' (display output only).  Passing a prefix argument
(`C-u') to any of the following commands, however, reverses the meaning
of `ess-eval-visibly-p' for that command only -- for example `C-u C-c
C-j' echoes the current line of S (or other) code in the ESS process
buffer, followed by its output.  This method of evaluation is an
alternative to S's `source()' function when you want the input as well
as the output to be displayed.  (You can sort of do this with
`source()' when the option `echo=T' is set, except that prompts do not
get displayed.  ESS puts prompts in the right places.) The commands for
evaluating code are:

   * `C-c C-j' (`ess-eval-line')
     Send the line containing point to the ESS process.

   * `C-c M-j' (`ess-eval-line-and-go')
     As above, but returns you to the ESS process buffer as well.

   * `C-c C-f' or `ESC C-x' (aka `M-C-x') (`ess-eval-function')
     Send the S function containing point to the ESS process.

   * `C-c M-f' (`ess-eval-function-and-go')
     As above, but returns you to the ESS process buffer as well.

   * `C-c C-r' (`ess-eval-region')
     Send the text between point and mark to the ESS process.

   * `C-c M-r' (`ess-eval-region-and-go')
     As above, but returns you to the ESS process buffer as well.

   * `C-c C-b' (`ess-eval-buffer')
     Send the contents of the edit buffer to the ESS process.

   * `C-c M-b' (`ess-eval-buffer-and-go')
     As above, but returns you to the ESS process buffer as well.

   * `C-c C-n' (`ess-eval-line-and-step')
     Sends the current line to the ESS process, echoing it in the
     process buffer, and moves point to the next line.  Useful when
     debugging for stepping through your code.

   It should be stressed once again that these `ess-eval-' commands
should only be used for evaluating small portions of code for debugging
purposes, or for generating transcripts from source files.  When editing
S functions, `C-c C-l' is the command to use to update the function's
value.  In particular, `ess-eval-buffer' is now largely obsolete.

   One final command is provided for spot-evaluations of S code:

     `C-c C-t' (`ess-execute-in-tb')
     Prompt for an S expression and evaluate it.  Displays result in a
     temporary buffer.

This is useful for quick calculations, etc.

   All the above commands are useful for evaluating small amounts of
code and observing the results in the process buffer.  A useful way to
work is to divide the frame into two windows; one containing the source
code and the other containing the process buffer.  If you wish to make
the process buffer scroll automatically when the output reaches the
bottom of the window, you will need to set the variable
`comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-output' to `'others' or `t'.

File: ess.info,  Node: Indenting,  Next: Other edit buffer commands,  Prev: Evaluating code,  Up: Editing

7.5 Indenting and formatting S code
===================================

ESS now provides a sophisticated mechanism for indenting S source code
(thanks to Ken'ichi Shibayama).  Compound statements (delimited by `{'
and `}') are indented relative to their enclosing block.  In addition,
the braces have been electrified to automatically indent to the correct
position when inserted, and optionally insert a newline at the
appropriate place as well.  Lines which continue an incomplete
expression are indented relative to the first line of the expression.
Function definitions, `if' statements, calls to `expression()' and loop
constructs are all recognized and indented appropriately.  User
variables are provided to control the amount if indentation in each
case, and there are also a number of predefined indentation styles to
choose from.  *Note Indentation variables::.

   Comments are also handled specially by ESS, using an idea borrowed
from the Emacs-Lisp indentation style.  By default, comments beginning
with `###' are aligned to the beginning of the line.  Comments
beginning with `##' are aligned to the current level of indentation for
the block containing the comment.  Finally, comments beginning with `#'
are aligned to a column on the right (the 40th column by default, but
this value is controlled by the variable `comment-column',) or just
after the expression on the line containing the comment if it extends
beyond the indentation column.  You turn off the default behavior by
adding the line `(setq ess-fancy-comments nil)' to your `.emacs' file.  

   The indentation commands provided by ESS are: 

   * `TAB' (`ess-indent-command')
     Indents the current line as S code.  If a prefix argument is given,
     all following lines which are part of the same (compound)
     expression are indented by the same amount (but relative indents
     are preserved).

   * `LFD' (`newline-and-indent')
     Insert a newline, and indent the next line.  (Note: if your
     keyboard does not have a <LINEFEED> key, you can use `C-j'
     instead.)  Some people prefer to bind <RET> to this command.

   * `ESC C-q' aka `M-C-q' aka `C-M-q' (`ess-indent-exp')
     Indents each line in the S (compound) expression which follows
     point.  Very useful for beautifying your S code.

   * `{' and `}' (`ess-electric-brace')
     The braces automatically indent to the correct position when typed.

   * `M-;' (`indent-for-comment')
     Indents a comment line appropriately, or inserts an empty
     (single-`#') comment.

   * `M-x ess-set-style'
     Set the formatting style in this buffer to be one of the predefined
     styles: `GNU', `BSD', `K&R', `CLB', and `C++'.  The `DEFAULT'
     style uses the default values for the indenting variables (unless
     they have been modified in your `.emacs' file.)  This command
     causes all of the formatting variables *note Indentation
     variables:: to be buffer-local.

7.6 Commands for motion, completion and more
============================================

A number of commands are provided to move across function definitions
in the edit buffer:
   * `ESC C-a' aka `C-M-a' (`ess-beginning-of-function')
     Moves point to the beginning of the function containing point.

   * `ESC C-e' aka `C-M-e' (`ess-end-of-function')
     Moves point to the end of the function containing point.

   * `ESC C-h' aka `C-M-h' (`ess-mark-function')
     Places point at the beginning of the S function containing point,
     and mark at the end.
   Don't forget the usual Emacs commands for moving over balanced
expressions and parentheses: *Note Lists and Sexps: (Emacs)Lists.

   Completion is provided in the edit buffer in a similar fashion to the
process buffer: `M-TAB' completes file names and `M-?' lists file
completions.  Since <TAB> is used for indentation in the edit buffer,
object completion is now performed with `C-c TAB'.  Note however that
completion is only provided over globally known S objects (such as
system functions) -- it will _not_ work for arguments to functions or
other variables local to the function you are editing.

   Finally, two commands are provided for returning to the ESS process
buffer:

   * `C-c C-z' (`ess-switch-to-end-of-ESS')
     Returns you to the ESS process buffer, placing point at the end of
     the buffer.

   * `C-c C-y' (`ess-switch-to-ESS')
     Also returns to to the ESS process buffer, but leaves point where
     it was.

   In addition some commands available in the process buffer are also
available in the edit buffer.  You can still read help files with `C-c
C-v', edit another function with `C-c C-d' and of course `C-c C-l' can
be used to load a source file into S.  *Note Other::, for more details
on these commands.

7.7 Maintaining S source files
==============================

Every edit buffer in ESS is associated with a "dump file" on disk.
Dump files are created whenever you type `C-c C-d'
(`ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer'), and may either be deleted after
use, or kept as a backup file or as a means of keeping several versions
of an S function.  

 -- User Option: ess-delete-dump-files
     If non-`nil', dump files created with C-c C-d are deleted
     immediately after they are created by the ess-process.

   Since immediately after S dumps an object's definition to a disk
file the source code on disk corresponds exactly to S's idea of the
object's definition, the disk file isn't needed; deleting it now has the
advantage that if you _don't_ modify the file (say, because you just
wanted to look at the definition of one of the standard S functions)
the source dump file won't be left around when you kill the buffer.
Note that this variable only applies to files generated with S's `dump'
function; it doesn't apply to source files which already exist.  The
default value is `t'.

 -- User Option: ess-keep-dump-files
     Option controlling what to do with the dump file after an object
     has been successfully loaded into S.  Valid values are `nil'
     (always delete), `ask' (always ask whether to delete), `check'
     (delete files generated with `C-c C-d' in this Emacs session,
     otherwise ask -- this is the default) and `t' (never delete).
     This variable is buffer-local.

   After an object has been successfully (i.e. without error) loaded
back into S with `C-c C-l', the disk file again corresponds exactly
(well, almost -- see below) to S's record of the object's definition,
and so some people prefer to delete the disk file rather than
unnecessarily use up space.  This option allows you to do just that.

   If the value of `ess-keep-dump-files' is `t', dump files are never
deleted after they are loaded.  Thus you can maintain a complete text
record of the functions you have edited within ESS.  Backup files are
kept as usual, and so by using the Emacs numbered backup facility --
*note Single or Numbered Backups: (emacs)Backup Names, you can keep a
historic record of function definitions.  Another possibility is to
maintain the files with a version-control system such as RCS *Note
Version Control: (emacs)Version Control.  As long as a dump file exists
in the appropriate place for a particular object, editing that object
with `C-c C-d' finds that file for editing (unless a prefix argument is
given) -- the ESS process is not consulted.  Thus you can keep comments
_outside_ the function definition as a means of documentation that does
not clutter the S object itself.  Another useful feature is that you
may format the code in any fashion you please without S re-indenting
the code every time you edit it.  These features are particularly
useful for project-based work.

   If the value of `ess-keep-dump-files' is nil, the dump file is always
silently deleted after a successful load with `C-c C-l'.  While this is
useful for files that were created with `C-c C-d' it also applies to
any other file you load (say, a source file of function definitions),
and so can be dangerous to use unless you are careful.  Note that since
`ess-keep-dump-files' is buffer-local, you can make sure particular
files are not deleted by setting it to `t' in the Local Variables
section of the file *Note Local Variables in Files: (emacs)File
Variables.

   A safer option is to set `ess-keep-dump-files' to `ask'; this means
that ESS will always ask for confirmation before deleting the file.
Since this can get annoying if you always want to delete dump files
created with `C-c C-d', but not any other files, setting
`ess-keep-dump-files' to `check' (the default value) will silently
delete dump files created with `C-c C-d' in the current Emacs session,
but query for any other file.  Note that in any case you will only be
asked for confirmation once per file, and your answer is remembered for
the rest of the Emacs session.

   Note that in all cases, if an error (such as a syntax error) is
detected while loading the file with `C-c C-l', the dump file is _never_
deleted.  This is so that you can edit the file in a new Emacs session
if you happen to quit Emacs before correcting the error.

   Dump buffers are always autosaved, regardless of the value of
`ess-keep-dump-files'.

7.8 Names and locations of dump files
=====================================

Every dump file should be given a unique file name, usually the dumped
object name with some additions.

 -- User Option: ess-dump-filename-template
     Template for filenames of dumped objects.  `%s' is replaced by the
     object name.

By default, dump file names are the user name, followed by `.' and the
object and ending with `.S'.  Thus if user `joe' dumps the object
`myfun' the dump file will have name `joe.myfun.S'.  The username part
is included to avoid clashes when dumping into a publicly-writable
directory, such as `/tmp'; you may wish to remove this part if you are
dumping into a directory owned by you.

   You may also specify the directory in which dump files are written:

 -- User Option: ess-source-directory
     Directory name (ending in a slash) where S dump files are to be
     written.

   By default, dump files are always written to `/tmp', which is fine
when `ess-keep-dump-files' is `nil'.  If you are keeping dump files,
then you will probably want to keep them somewhere in your home
directory, say `~/S-source'.  This could be achieved by including the
following line in your `.emacs' file: 
     (setq ess-source-directory (expand-file-name "~/S-source/"))

   If you would prefer to keep your dump files in separate directories
depending on the value of some variable, ESS provides a facility for
this also.  By setting `ess-source-directory' to a lambda expression
which evaluates to a directory name, you have a great deal of
flexibility in selecting the directory for a particular source file to
appear in.  The lambda expression is evaluated with the process buffer
as the current buffer and so you can use the variables local to that
buffer to make your choice.  For example, the following expression
causes source files to be saved in the subdirectory `Src' of the
directory the ESS process was run in.

     (setq ess-source-directory
           (lambda ()
              (concat ess-directory "Src/")))

(`ess-directory' is a buffer-local variable in process buffers which
records the directory the ESS process was run from.)  This is useful if
you keep your dump files and you often edit objects with the same name
in different ESS processes.  Alternatively, if you often change your S
working directory during an S session, you may like to keep dump files
in some subdirectory of the directory pointed to by the first element
of the current search list.  This way you can edit objects of the same
name in different directories during the one S session: 
     (setq ess-source-directory
        (lambda ()
            (file-name-as-directory
             (expand-file-name (concat
                                (car ess-search-list)
                                "/.Src")))))
   
   If the directory generated by the lambda function does not exist but
can be created, you will be asked whether you wish to create the
directory.  If you choose not to, or the directory cannot be created,
you will not be able to edit functions.

8 Reading help files in ESS
***************************

ESS provides an easy-to-use facility for reading S help files from
within Emacs.  From within the ESS process buffer or any ESS edit
buffer, typing `C-c C-v' (`ess-display-help-on-object') will prompt you
for the name of an object for which you would like documentation.
Completion is provided over all objects which have help files.

   If the requested object has documentation, you will be popped into a
buffer (named `*help(OBJ-NAME)*') containing the help file.  This
buffer is placed in a special `S Help' mode which disables the usual
editing commands but which provides a number of keys for paging through
the help file:

     Help commands:

   * `?' (`ess-describe-help-mode')
     Pops up a help buffer with a list of the commands available in S
     help mode.

   * `h' (`ess-display-help-on-object')
     Pop up a help buffer for a different object

     Paging commands:

   * `b' or `DEL' (`scroll-down')
     Move one page backwards through the help file.

   * `SPC' (`scroll-up')
     Move one page forwards through the help file.

   * `>' (`beginning-of-buffer') and `<' (`end-of-buffer')
     Move to the beginning and end of the help file, respectively.

     Section-based motion commands:

   * `n' (`ess-skip-to-next-section') and `p'
     (`ess-skip-to-previous-section')
     Move to the next and previous section header in the help file,
     respectively.  A section header consists of a number of
     capitalized words, followed by a colon.

     In addition, the `s' key followed by one of the following letters
     will jump to a particular section in the help file: 
    `a'
          ARGUMENTS:

    `b'
          BACKGROUND:

    `B'
          BUGS:

          NOTE:

    `o'
          OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS:

    `r'
          REQUIRED ARGUMENTS:

    `R'
          REFERENCES:

    `s'
          SIDE EFFECTS:

    `s'
          SEE ALSO:

    `u'
          USAGE:

    `v'
          VALUE:

    `<'
          Jumps to beginning of file

    `>'
          Jumps to end of file

    `?'
          Pops up a help buffer with a list of the defined section
          motion keys.

     Miscellaneous:

   * `l' (`ess-eval-line-and-step')
     Evaluates the current line in the ESS process, and moves to the
     next line.  Useful for running examples in help files.

   * `r' (`ess-eval-region')
     Send the contents of the current region to the ESS process.  Useful
     for running examples in help files.

   * `/' (`isearch-forward')
     Same as `C-s'.

     Quit commands:

   * `q' (`ess-switch-to-end-of-ESS')
     Returns to the ESS process buffer in another window, leaving the
     help window visible.

   * `k' (`kill-buffer')
     Kills the help buffer.

   * `x' (`ess-kill-buffer-and-go')
     Return to the ESS process, killing this help buffer.

   In addition, all of the ESS commands available in the edit buffers
are also available in S help mode (*note Edit buffer::).  Of course, the
usual (non-editing) Emacs commands are available, and for convenience
the digits and <-> act as prefix arguments.

   If a help buffer already exists for an object for which help is
requested, that buffer is popped to immediately; the ESS process is not
consulted at all.  If the contents of the help file have changed, you
either need to kill the help buffer first, or pass a prefix argument
(with `C-u') to `ess-display-help-on-object'.

   Help buffers are marked as temporary buffers in ESS, and are deleted
when `ess-quit' or `ess-cleanup' are called.

   Help buffers normally appear in another window within the current
frame.  If you wish help buffers to appear in their own frame (either
one per help buffer, or one for all help buffers), you can customize the
variable `ess-help-own-frame'.

9 Manipulating saved transcript files
*************************************

Inferior S mode records the transcript (the list of all commands
executed, and their output) in the process buffer, which can be saved as
a "transcript file", which should normally have the suffix `.St'.  The
most obvious use for a transcript file is as a static record of the
actions you have performed in a particular S session.  Sometimes,
however, you may wish to re-execute commands recorded in the transcript
file by submitting them to a running ESS process.  This is what
Transcript Mode is for.

   If you load file a with the suffix `.St' into Emacs, it is placed in
S Transcript Mode.  Transcript Mode is similar to Inferior S mode
(*note Entering commands::): paragraphs are defined as a command and
its output, and you can move though commands either with the paragraph
commands or with `C-c C-p' and `C-c C-n'.

* Menu:

* Resubmit::                    Resubmitting commands from the transcript file
* Clean::                       Cleaning transcript files


File: ess.info,  Node: Resubmit,  Next: Clean,  Prev: Transcript Mode,  Up: Transcript Mode

9.1 Resubmitting commands from the transcript file
==================================================

Three commands are provided to re-submit command lines from the
transcript file to a running ESS process.  They are:

   * `RET' (`ess-transcript-send-command')
     Send the current command line to the ESS process, and execute it.  

   * `C-c RET' (`ess-transcript-copy-command')
     Copy the current command to the ESS process, and switch to the ESS
     process buffer (ready to edit the copied command).  

   * `M-RET' (`ess-transcript-send-command-and-move')
     Send the current command to the ESS process, and move to the next
     command line.  This command is useful for submitting a series of
     commands.

Note that these commands are similar to those on the same keys in
Inferior S Mode.  In all three cases, the commands should be executed
when the cursor is on a command line in the transcript; the prompt is
automatically removed before the command is submitted.

9.2 Cleaning transcript files
=============================

Yet another use for transcript files is to extract the command lines for
inclusion in an S source file or function.  Transcript mode provides
one command which does just this:

   * `C-c C-w' (`ess-transcript-clean-region')
     Deletes all prompts and command output in the region, leaving only
     the commands themselves.

The remaining command lines may then be copied to a source file or edit
buffer for inclusion in a function definition, or may be evaluated
directly (*note Evaluating code::) using the code evaluation commands
from S mode, also available in S Transcript Mode.

10 Other features of ESS
************************

ESS has a few miscellaneous features, which didn't fit anywhere else.

* Menu:

* Highlighting::                Syntactic highlighting of buffers
* Graphics::                    Using graphics with ESS
* Imenu::                       Support for Imenu in ESS
* Toolbar::                     Support for toolbar in ESS
* Object Completion::


File: ess.info,  Node: Highlighting,  Next: Graphics,  Prev: Miscellaneous,  Up: Miscellaneous

10.1 Syntactic highlighting of buffers
======================================

ESS provides Font-Lock (*note Using Multiple Typefaces: (emacs)Faces.)
patterns for Inferior S Mode, S Mode, and S Transcript Mode buffers.  

   To activate highlighting, you need to turn on Font Lock mode in the
appropriate buffers.  This can be done on a per-buffer basis with `M-x
font-lock-mode', or may be done by adding `turn-on-font-lock' to
`inferior-ess-mode-hook', `ess-mode-hook' and `ess-transcript-mode-hook'
(*note Hooks::).  Your systems administrator may have done this for you
in `ess-site.el' (*note Customization::).

   The font-lock patterns are defined in three variables, which you may
modify if desired:

 -- Variable: inferior-ess-font-lock-keywords
     Font-lock patterns for Inferior ESS Mode.  The default value
     highlights prompts, inputs, assignments, output messages, vector
     and matrix labels, and literals such as `NA' and `TRUE'.

 -- Variable: ess-mode-font-lock-keywords
     Font-lock patterns for ESS programming mode.  The default value
     highlights function names, literals, assignments, source functions
     and reserved words.

 -- Variable: ess-trans-font-lock-keywords
     Font-lock patterns for ESS Transcript Mode.  The default value
     highlights the same patterns as in Inferior ESS Mode.


File: ess.info,  Node: Graphics,  Next: Imenu,  Prev: Highlighting,  Up: Miscellaneous

10.2 Using graphics with ESS
============================

One of the main features of the `S' package is its ability to generate
high-resolution graphics plots, and ESS provides a number of features
for dealing with such plots.

* Menu:

* printer::                     The printer() graphics driver
* X11::                         The X11() (and other X-windows based) driver
* winjava::                     Java Graphics Device


File: ess.info,  Node: printer,  Next: X11,  Prev: Graphics,  Up: Graphics

10.2.1 Using ESS with the `printer()' driver
--------------------------------------------

This is the simplest (and least desirable) method of using graphics
within ESS.  S's `printer()' device driver produces crude character
based plots which can be contained within the ESS process buffer
itself.  To start using character graphics, issue the S command
     printer(width=79)
   (the `width=79' argument prevents Emacs line-wrapping at column 80
on an 80-column terminal.  Use a different value for a terminal with a
different number of columns.) Plotting commands do not generate
graphics immediately, but are stored until the `show()' command is
issued, which displays the current figure.


File: ess.info,  Node: X11,  Next: winjava,  Prev: printer,  Up: Graphics

10.2.2 Using ESS with windowing devices
---------------------------------------

Of course, the ideal way to use graphics with ESS is to use a windowing
system.  Under X11, this requires that the DISPLAY environment variable
be appropriately set, which may not always be the case within your
Emacs process.  ESS provides a facility for setting the value of
DISPLAY before the ESS process is started if the variable
`ess-ask-about-display' is non-`nil'.  *Note Variables for starting
ESS::, for details of this variable.


File: ess.info,  Node: winjava,  Prev: X11,  Up: Graphics

10.2.3 Java Graphics Device
---------------------------

S+6.2 on Windows contains a java library that supports graphics.  Send
the commands:

     library(winjava)
     java.graph()

to start the graphics driver.  This allows you to use ESS for both
interaction and graphics within S-PLUS.  (Thanks to Tim Hesterberg for
this information.)


File: ess.info,  Node: Imenu,  Next: Toolbar,  Prev: Graphics,  Up: Miscellaneous

10.3 Imenu
==========

Imenu is an Emacs tool for providing mode-specific buffer indexes.  In
some of the ESS editing modes, support for Imenu is provided.  For
example, in S mode buffers, the menubar should display an item called
"Imenu-S".  Within this menubar you will then be offered bookmarks to
particular parts of your source file (such as the starting point of each
function definition).


File: ess.info,  Node: Toolbar,  Next: Object Completion,  Prev: Imenu,  Up: Miscellaneous

10.4 Toolbar
============

The R and S editing modes have support for a toolbar.  This toolbar
provides icons to act as shortcuts for starting new S/R processes, or
for evaluating regions of your source buffers.  The toolbar should be
present if your emacs can display images.  *Note Customization::, for
ways to change the toolbar.


File: ess.info,  Node: Object Completion,  Prev: Toolbar,  Up: Miscellaneous

10.5 Object Completion
======================

If you are running S-PLUS or R, you might consider installing the
database files.  From within Emacs, "C-x d" to the directory containing
ESS.  Now:

   `M-x S+3'

   (get S-PLUS running.  once you have reached the SPLUS 3.x prompt,
do:)

   `M-x ess-create-object-name-db'

   (this will create the file: ess-s+3-namedb.el; if it isn't in the ESS
directory, move it there).

   Then, completions will be autoloaded and will not be regenerated for
every session.

   For R:

   `M-x R'

   (get R running.  once you have reached the R prompt, do:)

   `M-x ess-create-object-name-db'

   (this will create the file: ess-r-namedb.el; if it isn't in the ESS
directory, move it there).

File: ess.info,  Node: Bugs,  Next: Reporting Bugs,  Prev: Bugs Etc,  Up: Bugs Etc

11.1 Bugs
=========

   * Commands like `ess-display-help-on-object' and list completion
     cannot be used while the user is entering a multi-line command.
     The only real fix in this situation is to use another ESS process.

   * The `ess-eval-' commands can leave point in the ESS process buffer
     in the wrong place when point is at the same position as the last
     process output.  This proves difficult to fix, in general, as we
     need to consider all _windows_ with `window-point' at the right
     place.

   * It's possible to clear the modification flag (say, by saving the
     buffer) with the edit buffer not having been loaded into S.

   * Backup files can sometimes be left behind, even when
     `ess-keep-dump-files' is `nil'.

   * Passing an incomplete S expression to `ess-execute' causes ESS to
     hang.

   * The function-based commands don't always work as expected on
     functions whose body is not a parenthesized or compound
     expression, and don't even recognize anonymous functions (i.e.
     functions not assigned to any variable).

   * Multi-line commands could be handled better by the command history
     mechanism.


File: ess.info,  Node: Reporting Bugs,  Next: Mailing Lists,  Prev: Bugs,  Up: Bugs Etc

11.2 Reporting Bugs
===================

Please send bug reports, suggestions etc. to

   <ESS-bugs@stat.math.ethz.ch>

   The easiest way to do this is within Emacs by typing

   `M-x ess-submit-bug-report'

   This also gives the maintainers valuable information about your
installation which may help us to identify or even fix the bug.

   If Emacs reports an error, backtraces can help us debug the problem.
Type "M-x set-variable RET debug-on-error RET t RET".  Then run the
command that causes the error and you should see a *Backtrace* buffer
containing debug information; send us that buffer.

   Note that comments, suggestions, words of praise and large cash
donations are also more than welcome.

11.3 Mailing Lists
==================

There is a mailing list for discussions and announcements relating to
ESS.  Join the list by sending an e-mail with "subscribe ess-help" (or
"help") in the body to <ess-help-request@stat.math.ethz.ch>;
contributions to the list may be mailed to
<ess-help@stat.math.ethz.ch>.  Rest assured, this is a fairly
low-volume mailing list.

   The purposes of the mailing list include

   *  helping users of ESS to get along with it.

   *  discussing aspects of using ESS on Emacs and XEmacs.

   *  suggestions for improvements.

   *  announcements of new releases of ESS.

Appendix A Customizing ESS
**************************

ESS can be easily customized to your taste simply by including the
appropriate lines in your `.emacs' file.  There are numerous variables
which affect the behavior of ESS in certain situations which can be
modified to your liking.  Keybindings may be set or changed to your
preferences, and for per-buffer customizations hooks are also available.

   Most of these variables can be viewed and set using the Custom
facility within Emacs.  Type `M-x customize-group RET ess RET' to see
all the ESS variables that can be customized.

* Menu:

* Variables::                   Variables for customization
* Hooks::                       Customizing ESS with hooks

File: ess.info,  Node: Variables,  Next: Hooks,  Prev: Customization,  Up: Customization

A.1 Variables for customization
===============================

ESS is easily customizable by means of setting variables in your
`.emacs' file.  In most cases, you can change defaults by including
lines of the form 
     (setq VARIABLE-NAME VALUE)
   in your `.emacs'.

   In what follows, variable names will be listed along with their
descriptions and default values.  Just substitute the variable name and
the new value into the template above.

File: ess.info,  Node: Variables for starting ESS,  Next: Dump file variables,  Prev: Variables,  Up: Variables

A.1.1 Variables for starting ESS
--------------------------------

 -- User Option: ess-ask-for-ess-directory
     Default: `t'
     If this variable has a non-`nil' value, then every time ESS is run
     with `M-x S' you will be prompted for a directory to use as the
     working directory for your S session; this directory should have a
     `.Data' subdirectory.  If the value of `ess-ask-for-ess-directory'
     is `nil', the value of `S-directory' is used as the working
     directory.

 -- User Option: S-directory
     Default: Your home directory
     The working directory for your S session if
     `ess-ask-for-ess-directory' is `nil', and the default when
     prompting for a directory if it is not.  For example, you may wish
     to set this to the value of the current buffer's working directory
     before starting S by adding the following line to your `.emacs'
     file (*note Hooks::) 
          (setq ess-pre-run-hook
             '((lambda () (setq S-directory default-directory))))

 -- User Option: ess-ask-about-display
     Default: `nil'
     If this variable has a non-`nil' value, then every time ESS is run
     with `M-x S' you will be asked for a value for the `DISPLAY'
     environment variable to be used in the current S session.  If this
     variable is not set correctly, S will not be able to create any
     windows under the X windowing environment.  Completion is provided
     over the `X-displays-list' variable; the default is the current
     value of `DISPLAY'.  This feature is useful is you often run S on
     a different display than that of the machine you are running S
     from.  If `ess-ask-about-display' is `nil', the current value of
     `DISPLAY' is used.

 -- User Option: X-displays-list
     Default: `'(":0.0")'
     List of possible values for the `DISPLAY' environment variable,
     provided for completion when prompting for such a value.


File: ess.info,  Node: Dump file variables,  Next: Indentation variables,  Prev: Variables for starting ESS,  Up: Variables

A.1.2 Variables for dump files
------------------------------

 -- User Option: ess-insert-function-templates
     Default: `t'
     If this variable has a non-`nil' value, then dumping a
     non-existent object will result in the edit buffer containing a
     skeleton function definition, ready for editing.

 -- User Option: ess-source-directory
     Default: `"/tmp/"'
     Directory name (ending in `/') in which dump files are placed.
     This should always be a writable directory.

 -- User Option: ess-source-directory-generator
     Default: `nil'
     Alternative, dynamic method of specifying the directory for dump
     files.

 -- User Option: ess-dump-filename-template
     Default: USER_NAME`.'OBJECT_NAME`.S'
     Naming system to use for dumped object files.  *Note Source
     Directories::, for details of this and the previous two variables.

 -- User Option: ess-keep-dump-files
     Default: `nil'
     Boolean flag signifying whether to keep dump files or to delete
     them after each use.  *Note Source Files::, for more details.


File: ess.info,  Node: Indentation variables,  Next: Variables controlling interaction,  Prev: Dump file variables,  Up: Variables

A.1.3 Variables controlling indentation
---------------------------------------

 -- User Option: ess-tab-always-indent
     Default: `t'
     If non-`nil', then `TAB' in the edit buffer always indents the
     current line, regardless of the position of point in the line.
     Otherwise, indentation is only performed if point is in the lines
     indentation, and a tab character is inserted is point is after the
     first nonblank character.

 -- User Option: ess-auto-newline
     Default: `nil'
     Non-`nil' means automatically newline before and after braces
     inserted in S code.

   The following variables control amounts of indentation.  These
variables automatically become buffer-local in any ESS buffer, and so
setting any of these variables has effect in the current buffer only.

 -- User Option: ess-indent-level
     Default: 2
     Extra indentation of S statement sub-block with respect to
     enclosing braces.

 -- User Option: ess-brace-imaginary-offset
     Default: 0
     Extra indentation (over sub-block indentation) for block following
     an open brace which follows on the same line as a statement.

 -- User Option: ess-brace-offset
     Default: 0
     Extra indentation for braces, compared with other text in same
     context.

 -- User Option: ess-continued-statement-offset
     Default: 0
     Extra indent for lines not starting new statements.

 -- User Option: ess-continued-brace-offset
     Default: 0
     Extra indent for substatements that start with open-braces.  This
     is in addition to `ess-continued-statement-offset'.

 -- User Option: ess-arg-function-offset
     Default: 2
     Extra indent for arguments of function `foo' when it is called as
     the value of an argument to another function in `arg=foo(...)'
     form.  If not number, the statements are indented at
     open-parenthesis following `foo'.

 -- User Option: ess-expression-offset
     Default: 4
     Extra indent for internal substatements of the call to
     `expression()' specified in 
          `obj <- expression(...)'
     form.  If not a number, the statements are indented at
     open-parenthesis following `expression'.

 -- User Option: ess-else-offset
     Default: 2
     Extra indentation of the `else' clause with respect to the
     corresponding `if'.

In addition, a number of default styles are defined for you (in
`ess-style-alist'): 

 -- User Option: ess-default-style
     Default: `DEFAULT'
     The default formatting style to use in edit buffers.  The DEFAULT
     style uses the values of the above indentation variables at
     load-time, so that changing these variables in your `.emacs' file
     will affect your buffer defaults.  Other styles are: `GNU', `BSD',
     `K&R', `CLB', and `C++'.  See `ess-cust.el' for the complete
     definitions of the styles.  *Note Edit buffer::, for more details.


File: ess.info,  Node: Variables controlling interaction,  Next: Editing assembly files,  Prev: Indentation variables,  Up: Variables

A.1.4 Variables controlling interaction with the ESS process
------------------------------------------------------------

 -- User Option: comint-input-ring-size
     Default: 50
     Number of commands to store in the command history.

 -- User Option: ess-execute-in-process-buffer
     Default: `nil'
     If this is `nil', then the `ess-execute-' commands (*note Other::)
     output to a temporary buffer.  Otherwise, the output goes to the
     ESS process.

 -- User Option: ess-eval-visibly-p
     Default: `nil'
     If non-`nil', then the `ess-eval-' commands (*note Edit buffer::)
     echo the S commands in the process buffer by default.  In any
     case, passing a prefix argument to the eval command reverses the
     meaning of this variable.


File: ess.info,  Node: Editing assembly files,  Prev: Variables controlling interaction,  Up: Variables

A.1.5 Variables for restoring assembly mode associations
--------------------------------------------------------

 -- User Option: auto-mode-alist
     Association list mapping file extensions to emacs modes.

   If you edit assembler files but not S files, you may want to retain
the default mode for the .s and .S extensions, namely assembler mode.
ESS provides a function, `ess-restore-asm-extns' that you can use to
restore default behavior for these files.

   You can add the following lisp to your `.emacs':
     (add-hook 'ess-mode-hook 'ess-restore-asm-extns)
     (add-hook 'inferior-ess-mode-hook 'ess-restore-asm-extns)
   This code removes the association between .s and .S files and S mode.


File: ess.info,  Node: Hooks,  Next: Keybindings,  Prev: Variables,  Up: Customization

A.2 Customizing ESS with hooks
==============================

ESS provides the following hooks:

 -- Hook: ess-mode-hook
     Called every time `ESS' is run.

 -- Hook: ess-mode-load-hook
     Called just after the file `ess.el' is loaded.  Useful for setting
     up your keybindings, etc.

 -- Hook: ess-pre-run-hook
     Called before the ESS process is started (e.g., with `M-x S').
     Good for setting up your directory.

 -- Hook: ess-post-run-hook
     Called just after the ESS process starts up.  This can be used to
     evaluate ESS code at the start of a session, with
     `ess-eval-visibly', say.

 -- Hook: inferior-ess-mode-hook
     For customizing inferior ESS mode.  Called after inferior-ess-mode
     is entered and variables have been initialized.

 -- Hook: ess-help-mode-hook
     Called every time when entering ess-help-mode (i.e., an ESS help
     buffer is generated).

 -- Hook: ess-send-input-hook
     Called just before line input is sent to the process.

 -- Hook: ess-transcript-mode-hook
     For customizing ESS transcript mode.


File: ess.info,  Node: Keybindings,  Prev: Hooks,  Up: Customization

A.3 Changing the default ESS keybindings
========================================

ESS provides a separate keymaps (keymap variables) for ESS process
buffers, edit buffers and for help buffers.  The key bindings in the
edit buffers further depend on the language and dialect in use.

 -- Keymap: inferior-ess-mode-map
     Keymap used in the ESS process buffer.  The bindings from
     `comint-mode-map' are automatically inherited.

 -- Keymap: ess-mode-map
     Keymap used within edit (ess-mode) buffers.

 -- Keymap: ess-eval-map
     Keymap used within edit buffers for sending ESS code to the running
     process.

 -- Keymap: ess-help-mode-map
     Keymap used within help buffers.  In addition, `ess-help-sec-map'
     is the keymap for the `s' prefix key.  Keys defined in
     `ess-help-sec-keys-alist' are automatically inserted into this
     keymap when ESS is loaded.

 -- Keymap: ess-transcript-mode-map
     Keymap used within ESS transcript buffers.
