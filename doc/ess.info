   This file documents `ESS', a GNU Emacs package for running
`S(plus)', `R', `XLisp-Stat', `SAS' and potentially any other
interactive `statistical' languages in an `inferior' buffer, editing
source code in these languages and interacting with the running program.

   This documentation relates to Version 5.1.21 of `ESS'.
