ESS -- Emacs Speaks Statistics
******************************

   Originally known as S-mode, written by Doug Bates, Ed Kademan, Frank
Ritter, and David Smith.

   Currently maintained by A.J. (Tony) Rossini, Richard M. Heiberger,
Kurt Hornik, Martin Maechler, and Rodney Sparapani.

   This file documents `ESS', a GNU Emacs package for running
`S(plus)', `R', `XLisp-Stat', `SAS' and potentially any other
interactive `statistical' languages in an `inferior' buffer, editing
source code in these languages and interacting with the running program.

   This documentation relates to Version 5.1.19 of `ESS'.
