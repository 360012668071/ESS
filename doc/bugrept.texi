The easiest way to do this is within Emacs by typing

@kbd{M-x ess-submit-bug-report}

This also gives the maintainers valuable information about your
installation which may help us to identify or even fix the bug.

Note that comments, suggestions, words of praise and large cash
donations are also more than welcome.
