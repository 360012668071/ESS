ESS version 5.1.3 requires Emacs version 19.29 or later, or version
XEmacs 19.14 or later.  ESS is supposed to work with any version of S,
S-PLUS, R, SAS, or XLispStat.

It has been most thoroughly tested with:

	S-PLUS versions 3.3, 3.4, 4.5, 5.0; R versions >=0.49;
	XLispStat versions >=3.50; S4; and SAS;
	
	on the following systems:
	   SunOS (all)
	   Solaris (all)
	   SGI (all)
	   Linux (S-PLUS 5.0, R, XLispStat, S4)
	   Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT (SPLUS 4.5)

	Emacs 19.29, 19.34, XEmacs 19.16, XEmacs 20.4, XEmacs 21.0

	Emacs 19.28 with SAS (with additional modifications)

	NTEmacs 20.2.1 with S-PLUS 4.5.

It may need some work with other configurations.  We include
configuration suggestions for emacs 19.28 in Doc/README-19.28.
These are the changes we made in order to use ESS with SAS on a Digital
Alpha running Emacs 19.28.

Work for porting to Microsoft-developed operating systems is
continuing, especially with Splus 4.x and NT Emacs.  Other possible
connections include XLispStat (under the Splus DDE interface), R, SAS,
SPSS, and Stata.  In addition, XEmacs support (for native NT and
Cygwin versions) needs to be evaluated.
