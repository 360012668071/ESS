ESS version 5.1.7 requires Emacs version 19.29 or later, or version
XEmacs 19.14 or later.  It has been most thoroughly tested with:

@itemize @bullet
@item S-PLUS versions 3.3, 3.4, 4.5, 5.0
@item R versions >=0.49
@item XLispStat versions >=3.50
@item S4
@item SAS
@item Stata >=6.0
@end itemize

on the following platforms

@itemize @bullet
@item SunOS (all)
@item Solaris (all)
@item SGI (all)
@item Linux (S-PLUS 5.0, R, XLispStat, S4, Stata 6.0)
@item Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT (SPLUS 4.5)
@end itemize

with the following Emacsen:

@itemize @bullet
@item Emacs 19.29, 19.34, XEmacs 19.16, XEmacs 20.4, XEmacs 21.0
@item Emacs 19.28 with SAS (with additional modifications)
@item NTEmacs 20.3.1 with S-PLUS 4.5.
@end itemize

It may need some work with other configurations.  We include
configuration suggestions for emacs 19.28 in Doc/README-19.28.
These are the changes we made in order to use ESS with SAS on a Digital
Alpha running Emacs 19.28.
