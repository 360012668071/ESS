updating problem}, 21.4.14-15; as of June 2004, ESS does not work with
XEmacs Betas such as 21.5.17
@item GNU Emacs <20.3 and XEmacs <21.0@footnote{These releases of emacs are no 
longer supported, so an upgrade is recommended if you plan to use ESS.
If you have GNU Emacs 19.29, see @xref{Unix installation}.  Also, note
that the `custom' library bundled with Emacs 19.34 is too _old_, its API is
incompatible with the `new custom' bundled with recent Emacsen.
The `new custom' for Emacs 19.34 is available for download
@uref{ftp://ftp.dina.kvl.dk/pub/Staff/Per.Abrahamsen/custom/custom-1.9962.tar.gz, here}.}
