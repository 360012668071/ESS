 2. Makefile
 PRELOADS =  -l extras.el -l ./ess-comp.el

 SOURCES = easymenu.el extras.el \


 3. where extras.el is the add-to-list function from somewhere in 'cl

 (defun add-to-list (list-var element)
   "Add to the value of LIST-VAR the element ELEMENT if it isn't there yet.
 If you want to use `add-to-list' on a variable that is not defined
 until a certain package is loaded, you should put the call to `add-to-list'
 into a hook function that will be run only after loading the package.
 `eval-after-load' provides one way to do this.  In some cases
 other hooks, such as major mode hooks, can do the job."
   (or (member element (symbol-value list-var))
       (set list-var (cons element (symbol-value list-var)))))


 4. where easymenu.el is copied from 19.29
