@c There no longer is an anonymous CVS repository for ESS, due to lack of
@c interest, little demand, and problems with security.

To get the latest development version of ESS, you need a subversion
client `svn' configured with `--with-ssl' support.  You can then do:

@example
% svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/ESS/trunk ess-svn
@end example
@noindent
which will put the ESS files into a subdirectory called ess-svn.  Later,
within that directory, `svn update' will bring that directory up to
date.  Windows-based tools such as TortoiseSVN are also available for
downloading the files.  Alternatively, you can browse the sources with a
web browser at: @uref{https://svn.r-project.org/ESS/trunk, ESS SVN
site}.  However, please use a subversion client instead to minimize the
load when retrieving.

If you remove other versions of ESS from your emacs load-path, you can
then use the development version by adding the following to .emacs:

@example
(load "/path/to/ess-svn/lisp/ess-site.el") 
@end example
