There no longer is an anonymous CVS repository for ESS, due to lack of
interest, little demand, and problems with security.

@c The latest public version of ESS can also be retrieved via cvs client.  
@c If you have a firewall, then you may need to take appropriate action.

@c The repository name is
@c @display
@c :pserver:anoncvs@@cvs.analytics.washington.edu:/var/anoncvs
@c @end display

@c Using a command-line cvs client (i.e. on Unix or DOS), first type:
@c @display
@c cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@@cvs.analytics.washington.edu:/var/anoncvs login
@c @end display

@c The password is "anoncvs".

@c Then type:
@c @display
@c cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@@cvs.analytics.washington.edu:/var/anoncvs co ess
@c @end display
