($Revision: 1.26 $, for ESS version @essver{})

This is the README file for the distribution of ESS version @essver{}, the
gamma series we are using on the way to producing 5.2 (the next
stable distribution).  ESS is an Emacs-Lisp interface for interactive
statistical programming and data analysis.  Languages supported include:
S dialects (S 3/4, S-PLUS 3/4/5/6, and R), LispStat dialects (XLispStat,
ViSta), and SAS.  Stata and SPSS dialect (SPSS, PSPP) support is being
examined for possible future implementation (a preliminary Stata mode is
distributed).

Installation help can be found in sections for Unix Installation or
Windows Installion


ESS grew out of the desire for bug fixes and extensions to S-mode-4.8.
In particular, XEmacs support as well as extensions to incorporate R
were desired.  In addition, with new modes being developed for R,
Stata, and SAS, it was felt that providing for a unifying framework
would eliminate differences in the user interface, as well as to
provide for faster development of production tools and statistical
analysis.  5.1.x has, for its guts, the basic framework from S-mode.
However, it has been cleaned, streamlined, brought closer to
conformance as a standard GNU Emacs package, and redesigned for
modularity and reuse.

The current development team is led by A.J. (Tony) Rossini
(@email{rossini@@biostat.washington.edu}), who did the initial port to
XEmacs and has been the primary coder.  Martin Maechler
(@email{maechler@@stat.math.ethz.ch}) and Kurt Hornik
(@email{hornik@@ci.tuwien.ac.at}) have assisted with S-PLUS, S4, R, and
XLispStat sub-modes, and Richard M. Heiberger 
(@email{rmh@@surfer.sbm.temple.edu}) has assisted with S-PLUS (under MS
Windows and remote access) and S4 development.  Richard and Rodney Sparapani 
(@email{rsparapa@@mcw.edu}) have done much of the work for implementing the 
SAS sub-mode.  Douglas Bates (@email{bates@@stat.wisc.edu}) contributed the 
initial S4 mode.

We are grateful to David M. Smith, the previous developer (for S-mode
3.x and 4.x), as well as to the initial developers of S-mode, Doug
Bates, Ed Kademan and Frank Ritter.

In addition, some of the code has been and will be borrowed from Tom
Cook (from his excellent SAS mode) and Thomas Lumley (preliminary
Stata mode), gratefully (from us) and with permission (from them).

The name is @b{ESS}.  Not ESS-mode.
