@chapter General Information: README
@cindex README

This is the README file for the distribution of ESS version 
@include ../VERSION

The final release of the 5.1.x series on the way to 5.2 (the next stable 
distribution).  ESS is a GNU Emacs and XEmacs mode for interactive
statistical programming and data analysis.  Languages supported:  the
S family (S 3/4, S-PLUS 3/4/5/6, and R), SAS, XLispStat, Stata and BUGS.
Installation help can be found in sections for both Unix and Windows.
ESS grew out of the desire for bug fixes and extensions to S-mode and 
SAS-mode as well as a consistent union of their features in one package.

The current development team is led by A.J. (Tony) Rossini
(@email{rossini@@biostat.washington.edu}), who did the initial port to
XEmacs and has been the primary coder.  Martin Maechler
(@email{maechler@@stat.math.ethz.ch}) and Kurt Hornik
(@email{hornik@@ci.tuwien.ac.at}) have assisted with S-PLUS, S4, R, and
XLispStat.  Richard M. Heiberger (@email{rmh@@surfer.sbm.temple.edu}) has 
assisted with S-PLUS and S4 development for Windows.  Richard and 
Rodney A. Sparapani (@email{rsparapa@@mcw.edu}) have done much of the work 
implementing interactive SAS (iESS[SAS]) and batch SAS (ESS[SAS]) support.  

We are grateful to the previous developers of S-mode (Doug Bates, Ed Kademan,
Frank Ritter, David M. Smith), SAS-mode (Tom Cook) and Stata-mode (Thomas 
Lumley).
@c The name is @b{ESS}.  Not ESS-mode.
