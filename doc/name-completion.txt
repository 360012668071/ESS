Name completion (for R and S-plus):
----------------

Want to keep an up-to-date list of S object names, on which we can
complete.
  Additionally, list-component completion "x$a<TAB>" also work;
  Not slot completion on S4 objects though  <<< TODO

Historically, for S and S-plus, we had made an effort to only reread
the objects of database entries in search() ``when needed''.
In particular, for directories, one had looked at their "modification time"
and kept as timestamp. And they were only re-read when the time changed.
For R, this is not available and for newer versions of S-plus, with
"compiled directories" this has become less of an issue;
...........
I think R does never re-read things as long as search() is not
changed by  library(), attach(), detach(), source(),..
These are, BTW, given by  ess-change-sp-regexp in ../lisp/ess-cust.el
(initialized by dialect specific ess-<dialect>-sp-regexp  "defcustom"s).

How are things working in ../lisp/ess-inf.el currently :

Main user functions

  ess-complete-object-name	and
  ess-resynch
  |				call the "main work horse"
  |
  |-> ess-get-object-list
      |
      |-> ess-get-modtime-list	{when one of the following var.s "says so"}:
      |
      |--> [Var] ess-sp-change
      |--> [Var] ess-sl-modtime-alist
      |
      \-> ess-extract-onames-from-alist
