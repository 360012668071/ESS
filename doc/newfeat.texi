      "Substitution" parameters facilitate "automagic" generation of
      "data...in" and "init...in" filenames, "const N=" from your data
      file and "monitor()/stats()" commands.  Activated by pressing F12.

      You must have the library defined in autoexec.sas for it to work.

      and `ess-sas-batch-post-command' as well Customize support for these

@item Many small (and large) fixes/contributions (MMaechler,

@itemize @bullet
@item  able to use inferior iESS mode to
communicate directly with a running S-Plus 4.x process using the
Microsoft DDE protocol.  We use the familiar (from Unix ESS) C-c C-n
and related key sequences to send lines from the S-mode file to the
inferior S process.  We continue to edit S input files in ESS[S] mode
and transcripts of previous S sessions in ESS Transcript mode.  All
three modes know the S language, syntax, and indentation patterns and
provide the syntactic highlighting that eases the programming tasks.
