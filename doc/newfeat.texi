Changes/New Features in 5.1.22:
@itemize @bullet
@item Besides info documentation, PDF and HTML
documentation are also provided (instead of built using "make") and available
on the web as well; see @uref{http://software.biostat.washington.edu/ess/doc,
 ESS web page} and @uref{http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/general/ESS/doc, StatLib}
@item Now that info documentation is available, the
README.* files are no longer supported.  However, they
are still distributed for what it's worth.
@item ESS is now an XEmacs package!  See
@uref{http://www.xemacs.org/Install/index.html, XEmacs Installation HOWTO}
for details (specifically, items 10-15).
@item ESS[SAS]: more user-friendly enhancements for remote
SAS batch jobs with Kermit file transfers (LOG and OUTPUT
function key features now supported).  Multiple shells
now supported so you can run SAS on different computers
from different buffers by setting the buffer-local variable
ess-sas-shell-buffer to unique buffer names.
@item Major re-vamping of Makefile/Makeconf.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.1.21:
@itemize @bullet
@item ESS[SAS]: info documentation now available!, see

either within emacs, when available, or via an external viewer;
more syntax highlighting keywords; more enhancements for remote
SAS batch jobs with Kermit; new framework for remote SAS interactive
jobs, see ess-remote
@item ESS[S]: info documentation now available!, see

@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.1.20:
@itemize @bullet
@item New `options()$STERM' in the S dialects (S, S-Plus, R).
The S program can determine the environment in which it is
currently running.  ESS sets the option to `iESS' or `ddeESS'
when it starts an S language process.  We recommend other specific
values for S language processes that ESS does not start.
@item New `ess-mouse-me' function, assigned to S-mouse-3 by default.
User may click on a word or region and then choose from the
menu to display the item, or a summary, or a plot, etc.
This feature is still under development.
@item GNU Emacs 21.1 is now supported (fixed for S dialects, SAS & BUGS),
(some from Stephen Eglen).
@item XEmacs 21.x is now supported (fixed w32-using-nt bug)
@item XEmacs on Win (NT) is better supported.
@item Workaround for bug in Sqpe+6 (S-PLUS 6 for Win).
@item should now work even when imenu is not available (for old Xemacsen).
@item ESS[SAS]: XEmacs-Imenu fix; C-TAB is globalized along with your
function-key definitions, if specified; you can specify your SAS
library definitions outside of autoexec.sas for ess-sas-data-view
with SAS code placed in the variable ess-sas-data-view-libname,
also the dataset name is defaulted to the nearest permanent dataset
to point; Speedbar support now works for permanent datasets, please
ignore first./last.; new font-locking is now the default with more
improvements for font-locking PROCs, macro statements, * ; and %* ;
comments; you can toggle sas-log-mode with F10 which will font-lock
your .log (if it isn't too big); submit remote .sas files accessed
with ange-ftp, EFS or Tramp (Kermit is experimental) by setting
ess-sas-submit-method to 'sh; ess-sas-submit-command and
ess-sas-submit-command-options are buffer-local so you can have
local file variable sections at the end of your .sas files to
request different executables or specify special options and the
local file variables are re-read at submit instead of only at file
open so that if you make a change it is picked up immediately;
@item ESS[BUGS]: font-lock with `in' fixed.
@item for STATA: font-lock bug fixed.
@item for Rd mode: C-c C-v and `switch-process' in menu.
further, C-c C-f prefix (Rd-font) for inserting or surrounding a word
by things such as \code@{.@}, \code@{\link@{.@}@}, \emph@{.@} etc.
@item new functions (ess-directory-function) and (ess-narrow-to-defun)
ess-directory <-> default-directory logic (Jeff Mincy).
@item Re-organized Makefile and fixed a few bugs.
@end itemize

@item S+6 now supported (Tony Rossini (Unix) and Rich Heiberger (Windows))
@item New BUGS support through ESS[BUGS] mode (Rodney Sparapani)
Templates assist you in writing .bug and .cmd code (.cmd and .log
are replaced by .bmd and .bog to avoid emacs extension collisions).
Substitution" parameters facilitate "automagic" generation of
data...in" and "init...in" filenames, "const N=" from your data
file and "monitor()/stats()" commands.  Activated by pressing F12.
@item Fixes for `ess-smart-underscore' SAS breakage (Rich Heiberger)
@item You can change between PC and Unix, local and global SAS function-key
definitions interactively (Rich Heiberger)
@item C-Submit a highlighted region to SAS batch (Rodney Sparapani)
@item New and improved SAS syntax highlighting (Rodney Sparapani)

Also available in .log files via F10.
@item Open a permanent SAS dataset for viewing via F9 (Rodney Sparapani)
You must have the library defined in autoexec.sas for it to work.

and `ess-sas-batch-post-command' as well Customize support for these
and other ESS[SAS] variables (Rodney Sparapani)
@item `ess-sas-suffix-2' now defaults to .dat via F11 (Rodney Sparapani)

@item Many small (and large) fixes/contributions (MMaechler)
@item addition of the "S-equal" variable and provide M-x ess-add-MM-keys
a way to remap "_" to `ess-S-assign', typically " <- ", but
customizable. (MMaechler)

Changes/New Features in 5.1.2:
@itemize @bullet
@item  able to use inferior iESS mode to
communicate directly with a running S-Plus 4.x process using the
Microsoft DDE protocol.  We use the familiar (from Unix ESS) C-c C-n
and related key sequences to send lines from the S-mode file to the
inferior S process.  We continue to edit S input files in ESS[S] mode
and transcripts of previous S sessions in ESS Transcript mode.  All
three modes know the S language, syntax, and indentation patterns and
provide the syntactic highlighting that eases the programming tasks.
