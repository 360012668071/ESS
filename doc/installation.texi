@subsection Packaged ESS

You may install ESS from Emacs by using @code{M-x package-install} if
you add the third-party package archive MELPA to
@code{package-archives}. Instructions on how to do so are found on
@uref{https://melpa.org/, MELPA's website}. MELPA also hosts
MELPA-stable with stable ESS builds. You may choose between MELPA with
the latest and greatest features (and bugs) or MELPA-stable, which may
lag a bit behind but should be more stable.

Alternatively, many GNU/Linux distributions package and distribute ESS,
check with your distribution to see if this is the case.  You may need
to add the above require statement to your configuration file in order
to activate ESS.

You will need to add

@example
(require 'ess-site)
@end example

@noindent
to your Emacs configuration file in order to activate ESS.  Advanced
users may activate only a particular language by loading @code{(require
'ess-r-mode)} instead.

@subsection From source

Users who wish to install ESS from the source code may follow these instructions:

@enumerate
@item Obtain the ESS source files.

@xref{Latest Version,,, ESS, ESS}

We will refer to the location of the ESS source files as
@file{/path/to/ESS/} hereafter.

@item @b{Optionally}, compile elisp files and build the documentation:
@example
cd /path/to/ESS/
make
@end example
Without this step, info, pdf and html documentation and reference card
will not be available. Uncompiled ESS will also run slower.

@item @b{Optionally}, install site-wide:

You may make ESS available to all users of a machine by installing it
site-wide. To do so, run @code{make install}. You might need
administrative privileges:

@example
make install
@end example

The files are installed into @code{/usr/share/emacs} directory. For this step to
run correctly on macOS, you will need to adjust the @file{PREFIX}
path in @file{Makeconf}. The necessary code and instructions are
commented in that file.

@item Initialize ESS

If you have performed the @code{make install} step from above, add:

@example
(require 'ess-site)
@end example

to your Emacs configuration file. Otherwise, you should add
@file{/path/to/ESS/lisp/} to your Emacs load path and then load ESS with
the following lines in your Emacs configuration file:

@example
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ESS/lisp/")
(require 'ess-site)
@end example

ess-site.el loads all ESS languages.  If you only want to load support
for R, you may use

@example
(require 'ess-r-mode)
@end example

@noindent
instead of ess-site.  Note that support for loading only part of ESS is
recommended only for experienced Emacs users.

@item Check installation
Restart your Emacs and check that ESS was loaded from a correct
location with @code{M-x ess-version}.
@end enumerate
