ANNOUNCING ESS
**************

   The ESS Developers proudly announce the release of ESS

   5.1.22

   -------------------------------------------------------------------

   Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) provides an intelligent, consistent
interface between the user and the software.  ESS interfaces with SAS,
S-PLUS, R, BUGS and other statistical analysis packages under the Unix,
Microsoft Windows, and Apple Mac operating systems.  ESS is itself a
package within the Emacs text editor and uses Emacs features to
streamline the creation and use of statistical software.  ESS knows the
syntax and grammar of statistical analysis packages and provides
consistent display and editing features based on that knowledge.  ESS
assists in interactive and batch execution of statements written in
these statistical analysis languages.

   ESS is freely available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
Please read the file COPYING which comes with the distribution, for
more information about the license. For more detailed information,
please read the README files that come with ESS.  And to clear up any
possible confusion; the name is ESS, NOT ESS-mode.

   Thank you :-).

Getting the Latest Version
==========================

   The latest stable version of ESS is always available on the web at:
ESS web page (http://software.biostat.washington.edu/ess/) or StatLib
(http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/general/ESS/)

   The latest (no more than 24 hours behind the developers) version of
ESS can also be retrieved using anonymous cvs:

   You need a cvs client (that works with your firewall, if any)

   the repository name is
`:pserver:anoncvs@software.biostat.washington.edu:/var/anoncvs'

   using a command-line cvs client (i.e. on Unix or DOS), first type:
`cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@software.biostat.washington.edu:/var/anoncvs
login'

   password is anoncvs

   then type:    `cvs -d

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note  that you must have `custom' support.  It is available at
The Custom Library (http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~abraham/custom/).   These
releases of emacs are no longer supported, so an upgrade is
recommended if you plan to use ESS.  If you have GNU Emacs 19.29,  see
*Note Unix installation::.

Stability
=========

   Versions 5.1.x are meant to be gamma-level releases.  While some bugs
are fixed, others may have been introduced, especially with regards to
new features.  See the file doc/TODO for details.  Bug reports are
solicited; see the Bugs Section below.  Patches or suggested coding
fixes with bug reports are much appreciated!

Mailing List
============

   There is a mailing list for discussions and announcements relating to
ESS.  Join the list by sending an e-mail with "subscribe ess-help" (or
"help") in the body to <ess-help-request@stat.math.ethz.ch>;
contributions to the list may be mailed to
<ess-help@stat.math.ethz.ch>.  Rest assured, this is a fairly
low-volume mailing list.

   The purposes of the mailing list include

   *  helping users of ESS to get along with it.

   *  discussing aspects of using ESS on Emacs and XEmacs.

   *  suggestions for improvements.

   *  announcements of new releases of ESS.

   *  posting small patches to ESS.

Reporting Bugs
==============

   Please send bug reports, suggestions etc. to

   <ESS-bugs@stat.math.ethz.ch>

   The easiest way to do this is within Emacs by typing

   `M-x ess-submit-bug-report'

   This also gives the maintainers valuable information about your
installation which may help us to identify or even fix the bug.

   Note that comments, suggestions, words of praise and large cash
donations are also more than welcome.

New Features
============

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.22:
   * Now that info documentation is available, the README.* files are
     no longer supported.  However, they are still distributed for what
     it's worth.

   * ESS is now an XEmacs package!  See XEmacs Installation HOWTO
     (http://www.xemacs.org/Install/index.html) for details
     (specifically, items 10-15).

   * ESS[SAS]: more user-friendly enhancements for remote SAS batch
     jobs with Kermit file transfers (LOG and OUTPUT function key
     features now supported).  Multiple shells now supported so you can
     run SAS on different computers from different buffers by setting
     the buffer-local variable ess-sas-shell-buffer to unique buffer
     names.

   * Major re-vamping of Makefile/Makeconf.

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.21:
   * ESS[SAS]: info documentation now available!, see ESS->Help for
     Statistical Packages->Help for SAS; F12 opens GSASFILE nearest
     point for viewing either within emacs, when available, or via an
     external viewer; more syntax highlighting keywords; more
     enhancements for remote SAS batch jobs with Kermit; new framework
     for remote SAS interactive jobs, see ess-remote

   * ESS[S]: info documentation now available!, see ESS->Help for
     Statistical Packages->Help for the S family

   * Makefile: tag now independent of rel; info files made by
     doc/Makefile and installed in new info sub-directory

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.20:
   * New `options()$STERM' in the S dialects (S, S-Plus, R).  The S
     program can determine the environment in which it is currently
     running.  ESS sets the option to `iESS' or `ddeESS' when it starts
     an S language process.  We recommend other specific values for S
     language processes that ESS does not start.

   * New `ess-mouse-me' function, assigned to S-mouse-3 by default.
     User may click on a word or region and then choose from the menu
     to display the item, or a summary, or a plot, etc.  This feature
     is still under development.

   * GNU Emacs 21.1 is now supported (fixed for S dialects, SAS & BUGS),
     (some from Stephen Eglen).

   * XEmacs 21.x is now supported (fixed w32-using-nt bug)

   * XEmacs on Win (NT) is better supported.

   * Workaround for bug in Sqpe+6 (S-PLUS 6 for Win).

   * should now work even when imenu is not available (for old
     Xemacsen).

   * ESS[SAS]: XEmacs-Imenu fix; C-TAB is globalized along with your
     function-key definitions, if specified; you can specify your SAS
     library definitions outside of autoexec.sas for ess-sas-data-view
     with SAS code placed in the variable ess-sas-data-view-libname,
     also the dataset name is defaulted to the nearest permanent dataset
     to point; Speedbar support now works for permanent datasets, please
     ignore first./last.; new font-locking is now the default with more
     improvements for font-locking PROCs, macro statements, * ; and %* ;
     comments; you can toggle sas-log-mode with F10 which will font-lock
     your .log (if it isn't too big); submit remote .sas files accessed
     with ange-ftp, EFS or Tramp (Kermit is experimental) by setting
     ess-sas-submit-method to 'sh; ess-sas-submit-command and
     ess-sas-submit-command-options are buffer-local so you can have
     local file variable sections at the end of your .sas files to
     request different executables or specify special options and the
     local file variables are re-read at submit instead of only at file
     open so that if you make a change it is picked up immediately;

   * ESS[BUGS]: font-lock with `in' fixed.

   * for STATA: font-lock bug fixed.

   * for Rd mode: C-c C-v and `switch-process' in menu.  further, C-c
     C-f prefix (Rd-font) for inserting or surrounding a word by things
     such as \code{.}, \code{\link{.}}, \emph{.} etc.

   * new functions (ess-directory-function) and (ess-narrow-to-defun)
     ess-directory <-> default-directory logic (Jeff Mincy).

   * Re-organized Makefile and fixed a few bugs.

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.19:
   * S+6 now supported (Tony Rossini (Unix) and Rich Heiberger
     (Windows))

   * New BUGS support through ESS[BUGS] mode (Rodney Sparapani)
     Templates assist you in writing .bug and .cmd code (.cmd and .log
     are replaced by .bmd and .bog to avoid emacs extension collisions).
     Substitution" parameters facilitate "automagic" generation of
     data...in" and "init...in" filenames, "const N=" from your data
     file and "monitor()/stats()" commands.  Activated by pressing F12.

   * Fixes for `ess-smart-underscore' SAS breakage (Rich Heiberger)

   * You can change between PC and Unix, local and global SAS
     function-key definitions interactively (Rich Heiberger)

   * C-Submit a highlighted region to SAS batch (Rodney Sparapani)

   * New and improved SAS syntax highlighting (Rodney Sparapani) To get
     the new functionality, set ess-sas-run-make-regexp to nil.  Also
     available in .log files via F10.

   * Open a permanent SAS dataset for viewing via F9 (Rodney Sparapani)
     You must have the library defined in autoexec.sas for it to work.

   * User-friendly defaults for `sas-program',
     `ess-sas-batch-pre-command' and `ess-sas-batch-post-command' as
     well Customize support for these and other ESS[SAS] variables
     (Rodney Sparapani)

   * `ess-sas-suffix-2' now defaults to .dat via F11 (Rodney Sparapani)

   * Emacs/XEmacs, Unix/Windows issues collectively handled in
     ess-emcs.el

   * defadvice solves problem of missing *ESS* (thanks to Jeff Mincy)

   * Improved manual a bit by including things that were only in
     `README'.

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.18:
   * New `ess-smart-underscore' function, now assigned to "_" by
     default.  Inserts `ess-S-assign' (customizable " <- "), unless
     inside string and comments where plain "_" is used instead. (MM)

   * Fixes for longstanding interactive SAS breakage (RMH)

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.17:
   * Documentation for Windows Installation (Rich Heiberger
     (<rmh@surfer.stat.temple.edu>))

   * removal of ess-vars, finalization of customize support (in the
     sense that there is no more use of ess-vars, but that we need to
     fix ess-cust) (AJ Rossini (<rossini@u.washington.edu>))

   * Many small (and large) fixes/contributions (MMaechler,
     (<maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>)).

   * addition of the "S-equal" variable and provide M-x ess-add-MM-keys
     a way to remap "_" to `ess-S-assign', typically " <- ", but
     customizable. (MMaechler, (<maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>)).

     (<rmh@surfer.stat.temple.edu>) and Rodney Sparapani
     <rsparapa@mcw.edu>)).

   * Customize support (for most Emacsen which support it) (AJRossini,
     (<rossini@biostat.washington.edu>)

   * ARC and ViSta support out of the box, and fixes for XLispStat
     (AJRossini, <rossini@biostat.washington.edu>)

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.13:
   * Version numbering finally all depending on the ./VERSION file,
     thanks to Martin Maechler.

   * Yet more fixes to SAS mode, thanks to Rich Heiberger
     (<rmh@surfer.stat.temple.edu>).

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.12:
   * Splus 5.1 stabilized, thanks to Martin Maechler, Bill Venables,
     Chuck Taylor, and others.

   * More fixes to SAS mode, thanks to Rodney Sparapani
     (<rsparapa@mcw.edu>) and Rich Heiberger
     (<rmh@surfer.stat.temple.edu>).

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.11:

   * R documentation mode defaults changed

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.2:
   * able to use inferior iESS mode to communicate directly with a
     running S-Plus 4.x process using the Microsoft DDE protocol.  We
     use the familiar (from Unix ESS) C-c C-n and related key sequences
     to send lines from the S-mode file to the inferior S process.  We
     continue to edit S input files in ESS[S] mode and transcripts of
     previous S sessions in ESS Transcript mode.  All three modes know
     the S language, syntax, and indentation patterns and provide the
     syntactic highlighting that eases the programming tasks.
