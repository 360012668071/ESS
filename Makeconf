## Updating ChangeLog via CVS with emacs requires the vc package!
## If this setting doesn't suit you, you can use the command line:
## make ChangeLog EMACSLOGCVS="myemacs -mybatchflags -mychangelogflags"

#EMACSLOGCVS=$(EMACSBATCH) -f vc-update-changelogs
# if Emacs:
#EMACSLOGCVS=$(EMACSBATCH) -f vc-update-change-log

## Some install commands expect target-directory source-file,
## but we want source-file target-directory; we also want to
## preserve owner, group and time-stamp; lastly, note that we
## are assuming that the target-directory exists

ESSVERSION=$(shell cat ./VERSION 2> /dev/null || cat ../VERSION)
