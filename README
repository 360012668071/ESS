General Information: README
***************************

   ($Revision: 5.21 $, for ESS 5.1.x)

   This is the README file for the distribution of ESS version 5.1.14,
the alpha/beta series we are using on the way to producing 5.2 (the next
stable distribution).  ESS is an Emacs-Lisp interface for interactive
statistical programming and data analysis.  Languages supported include:
S dialects (S 3/4, S-PLUS 3.x, and R), LispStat dialects (XLispStat,
ViSta), and SAS.  Stata and SPSS dialect (SPSS, PSPP) support is being
examined for possible future implementation (a preliminary Stata mode is
distributed).

For INSTALLATION, see way below.

   ESS grew out of the desire for bug fixes and extensions to
S-mode-4.8.  In particular, XEmacs support as well as extensions to
incorporate R were desired.  In addition, with new modes being
developed for R, Stata, and SAS, it was felt that providing for a
unifying framework would eliminate differences in the user interface,
as well as to provide for faster development of production tools and
statistical analysis.  5.1.y has, for its guts, the basic framework
from S-mode.  However, it has been cleaned, streamlined, brought closer
to conformance as a standard GNU Emacs package, and redesigned for
modularity and reuse.

   The current development team is led by A.J. (Tony) Rossini
(<rossini@biostat.washington.edu>), who did the initial port to XEmacs
and has been the primary coder.  Martin Maechler
(<maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>) and Kurt Hornik
(<hornik@ci.tuwien.ac.at>) have assisted with S-PLUS, S4, R, and
XLispStat sub-modes, and Richard M. Heiberger
(<rmh@fisher.stat.temple.edu>) has done much of the work for
implementing the SAS sub-mode, as well as assisted with S-PLUS (under MS
Windows and remote access) and S4 development.  Douglas Bates
(<bates@stat.wisc.edu>) contributed the initial S4 mode, as well as
provided disk space, ftp and http access to the source for development
purposes.

   We are grateful to David M. Smith, the previous developer (for S-mode
3.x and 4.x), as well as to the initial developers of S-mode, Doug
Bates, Ed Kademan and Frank Ritter.

   In addition, some of the code has been and will be borrowed from Tom
Cook (from his excellent SAS mode) and Thomas Lumley (preliminary Stata
mode), gratefully (from us) and with permission (from them).

   The name is ESS.  Not ESS-mode.

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.8:
   * Bug fixes

   * R documentation mode defaults changed

   Beginning with ESS 5.1.2 we are able to use inferior iESS mode to
communicate directly with a running S-Plus 4.x process using the
Microsoft DDE protocol.  We use the familiar (from Unix ESS) C-c C-n
and related key sequences to send lines from the S-mode file to the
inferior S process.  We continue to edit S input files in ESS[S] mode
and transcripts of previous S sessions in ESS Transcript mode.  All
three modes know the S language, syntax, and indentation patterns and
provide the syntactic highlighting that eases the programming tasks.

   For Microsoft platforms, the version of Emacs that this has been
tested with is NTEmacs 20.x, x greater than 2.  More information about
NTEmacs can be retrieved from:

   *   `http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/voelker/ntemacs.html'

   including information on retrieval and installation.  This has not
yet been tested with XEmacs for Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT.

Stability
=========

   Versions 5.1.x are meant as a beta-level releases.  While some bugs
are fixed from 5.0, others have been introduced, especially with
regards to new features.  See the file Doc/TODO for details.  Bug
reports are solicited; see the BUGS section below.  Patches or
suggested coding fixes with bug reports are much appreciated!

Requirements
============

   ESS version 5.1.n (n >= 2) requires Emacs version 19.29 or later, or
version XEmacs 19.14 or later.  It has been most thoroughly tested with:

   * S-PLUS versions 3.3, 3.4, 4.5, 5.0

   * R versions >=0.49

   * XLispStat versions >=3.50

   * S4

   * SAS

   * Stata >=6.0

   on the following platforms

   * SunOS (all)

   * Solaris (all)

   * SGI (all)

   * Linux (S-PLUS 5.0, R, XLispStat, S4, Stata 6.0)

   * Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT (SPLUS 4.5)

   with the following Emacsen:

   * Emacs 19.29, 19.34, 20.3, 20.4, XEmacs 19.16, XEmacs 20.4, XEmacs
     21.0

   * Emacs 19.28 with SAS (with additional modifications)

   * NTEmacs 20.3.1 with S-PLUS 4.5.

   It may need some work with other configurations.  We include
configuration suggestions for emacs 19.28 in Doc/README-19.28.  These
are the changes we made in order to use ESS with SAS on a Digital Alpha
running Emacs 19.28.

Getting the Latest Version
==========================

   The latest versions of ESS are always available by WWW from:

   	`http://ess.stat.wisc.edu/'
`ftp://ess.stat.wisc.edu/pub/ESS/'

   The HTML version of the documentation can be found at:

   `http://stat.ethz.ch/ESS/'

   The latest (no more than 24 hours behind the developers) version of
ESS can also be retrieved using anonymous CVS.  Details on this are
forthcoming.

Installation (from tar file)
============================

   *   cd to a directory where you keep emacs lisp files, or create a
     new   directory to hold the distribution.  This directory will be
     referred   to below as "the ESS distribution directory".  It will
     contain,   at the end, the tar file `ESS-5.1.14.tar.gz', and a
     directory for   the ESS source, which will be termed "the
     ESS-5.1.14 source directory".    Note that the .elc files may be
     installed elsewhere (as specified in the   Makefile) if desired.

   *   Retrieve the compressed tar file from one of the FTP or WWW
     archive   sites via FTP (or HTTP).

   *   Copy `ESS-5.1.14.tar.gz' to the location where you want the
     ESS-5.1.14 directory, and cd there.  Extract the files from the
     distribution, which will unpack into a subdirectory, ESS-5.1.14.
          	gunzip ESS-5.1.14.tar.gz
          	tar vxf ESS-5.1.14.tar
     	(or: `gunzip < ESS-5.1.14.tar.gz | tar vxf -' ).  	(or using GNU
     tar:  `tar zvxf ESS-5.1.14.tar.gz').

     The `tar' command will extract files into the current directory.

     Do not create ESS-5.1.14 yourself, or you will get an extra level
     of   depth to your directory structure.

   *   Edit the file `lisp/ess-site.el' as explained in the comments
     section of that file.  Installations that are using ESS only for
     S-plus   3.x will probably not need to make any changes.
     Installations that also   have one or more of (S+5 S4 R SAS
     XLispStat Stata) may need to uncomment   corresponding lines in
     `ess-site.el'.

   *   READ THIS ITEM THOROUGHLY BEFORE STARTING:

     In the ESS-5.1.14 directory, edit the file `Makeconf' (only if you
      want to place the executables in other locations; see LISPDIR and
      INFODIR) and then type:
          	make

     If this works, then you might try:
          	make install
       Note that the latter does the former as well, so if you are
     feeling   lucky, you might want to skip it.

     This will install the info files (and the lisp files, if they are
     to go   in another directory).  Don't forget to edit the file
     `dir' in the   info directory specified by `INFODIR' in
     `doc/Makefile'.  See   the sample `dir' file for an example of the
     line to add.

     If you are using XEmacs, you might do:
          	make EMACS=xemacs

     and then
          	make EMACS=xemacs install
       instead of editing the Makefile.

     _Note_ that you might need to use GNU make for everything to
     work properly

     An alternative, if you are running XEmacs and have access to the
     XEmacs system directories, would be to place the directory in the
     site-lisp directory, and simply type `make' (and copy the
     documentation as appropriate).

     For Emacs, you would still have to move the files into the top
     level   site-lisp directory.

   *   Add the line
            (load "/PATH/ess-site")
       to your .emacs file (or default.el or site-init.el, for a
     site-wide   installation).  Replace `/PATH' above with the value of
      ess-lisp-directory as defined in ess-site.el.

     Alternatively, if ess-site.el is in your current Lisp path, you can
      do:
          	(require 'ess-site)
       to configure Emacs for ESS.

   *   (OPTIONAL) If you are running S-PLUS or R, you might consider
     installing the database files.  From within (X)Emacs, `C-x d' to
     the   directory containing ESS.  Now:
                 M-x S+3
       (or M-x S+5: get running.  once you have reached the SPLUS
     prompt, do:)
                 M-x ess-create-object-name-db
       (this will create the file: ess-s+3-namedb.el; if it isn't in the
       ESS directory, move it there).

     Then, completions will be autoloaded and will not be regenerated
     for   every session.

     For R, do the same, using
                M-x R
       and then `M-x ess-create-object-name-db' creating
     `ess-r-namedb.el'; if it isn't in the ESS directory, move it
     there).

   *   For more information on using ESS in your daily work, see the
     files   README.S, README.SAS, and README.XLispStat.

     For the impatient, the quick version of usage follows:

   *   To edit statistical programs, load the files with the requiste
     extensions  (".sas" for SAS, ".S" for S-PLUS, ".R" for R, and
     ".lsp"   for XLispStat).

   *   To run statistical processes under (X)Emacs:

     Run S-PLUS 3.x with:
          	M-x S+3
       (or M-x S  using backwards compatibility).  You will then be
     asked   for a pathname ("S starting data directory?"), from which
     to start   the process.  Similarly for S-PLUS 5.x.

     If you wish to run R, you can start it with:
          	M-x R

     XLispStat can be run with
          	M-x XLS

     SAS can be run with:
          	M-x SAS

   *   That's it!

Installation (from anonymous CVS)
=================================

   To be added.

Reporting Bugs
==============

   Please send bug reports, suggestions etc. to

   <ESS-bugs@stat.math.ethz.ch>

   The easiest way to do this is within Emacs by typing

   `M-x ess-submit-bug-report'

   This also gives the maintainers valuable information about your
installation which may help us to identify or even fix the bug.

   Note that comments, suggestions, words of praise and large cash
donations are also more than welcome.

Mailing Lists
=============

   There is a mailing list for discussions and announcements relating to
ESS.  Join the list by sending an e-mail with "subscribe ess-help" (or
"help") in the body to <ess-help-request@stat.math.ethz.ch>;
contributions to the list may be mailed to
<ess-help@stat.math.ethz.ch>.  Rest assured, this is a fairly
low-volume mailing list.

   The purposes of the mailing list include

   - helping users of ESS to get along with it.  - discussing aspects
of using ESS for GNU Emacs and XEmacs.  - suggestions for improvements.
- announcements of new [beta] releases of ESS.  - posting small patches
to ESS.
