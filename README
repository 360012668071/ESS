2. REQUIREMENTS
---------------

ESS version 4.9 requires Emacs version 19.29 or later, or version
XEmacs 19.14 or later.  ESS is supposed to work with any version of S,
Splus, R, or XLispStat.  However it is most thoroughly tested with
Splus 3.3, R 0.49 and 0.50, and XLispStat 3.50 on SunOS, Solaris, and
Linux (Unix) systems; it may need some work with other configurations, 


3. STABILITY
------------

Version 4.9 is a functional release.  However, there are a few known
bugs (and countless other undiscovered ones); see the TODO file for
details.  Bug reports are solicited; see the BUGS section below.
Fixes and patches with bug reports are generously accepted.


4. INSTALLATION  (AJR: NEEDS TO BE CHANGED!).
---------------

* cd to a directory where you keep emacs lisp files, or create a new
  directory to hold the distribution.  This directory will be referred
  to below as "the ESS-4.9 directory".  Note that the .elc files
  may be installed elswehere (as specified in the Makefile) if
  desired.

* Copy ESS-4.9.tar.gz to the ESS-4.9 directory, and cd there.  Extract
  the files from the distribution: 

	gunzip ESS-4.9.tar.gz
	tar xvf ESS-4.9.tar

	(or using GNU tar:  tar zxvf ESS-4.9.tar.gz).

  The tar commmand will extract files into the current directory.

* Edit the file ess-site.el as explained in the comments section of
  that file.

* In the ESS-4.9 directory, edit the file Makefile and then type:

	make
	make install

  This will install the info files (and the lisp files, if they
  are to go in another directory).  Don't forget to edit the file
  `dir' in the info directory specified by INFODIR in the Makefile.

* Add the line

	(load "/PATH/ess-site")

  to your .emacs file (or to default.el, for a site-wide
  installation).  Replace `/PATH' above with the value of
  S-lisp-directory as defined in S-site.el.

* Start Emacs, and run S with:

	M-x S

  You should be asked for a pathname ("S starting data directory?");
  enter /PATH as defined above.

  After the S prompt appears, type M-x S-create-object-name-db.  This
  creates a database of object names (for completion purposes) in the
  file S-namedb.el in the current S directory (i.e. /PATH).  Check
  that /PATH now contains a file called S-namedb.el.  


  If you wish to run R, you can start it with:

	M-x R


  XLispStat can be run with 
	M-x XLS

* That's it!


5. BUGS
-------

Please send bug reports, suggestions etc. to rossini@stat.sc.edu.  The
easiest way to do this is within Emacs by typing 

	M-x ess-submit-bug-report 

This also gives me valuable information about your installation with
may help me to identify or even fix the bug.


6. GETTING THE LATEST VERSION
-----------------------------

The latest version of ESS is always available by WWW from
http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk:2080/~maa036/elisp/S-mode/.  ESS is
also available via anonymous FTP from
wingra.stat.wisc.edu:pub/src/emacs-lisp/.


7. THE ESS MAILING LIST
--------------------------

There is a mailing list for discussions and announcements relating to
ESS.  Join the list by sending an e-mail with "subscribe ess"
(or "help") in the body to ess-request@stat.math.ethz.ch;
contributions to the list may be mailed to ess@stat.math.ethz.ch.
Rest assured, this is a fairly low-volume mailing list.

The purposes of the mailing list include

- helping users of ESS to get along with it.
- discussing aspects of using ESS for GNU Emacs and XEmacs.
- suggestions for improvements.
- announcements of new [beta] releases of ESS.
- posting small patches to ESS.
