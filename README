Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS), version 5.1.x
------------------------------------------

This is the README file for the distribution of ESS version 5.1.x, the
alpha/beta series we are using on the way to producing 5.2 (the next
stable distribution).  ESS is an Emacs-Lisp interface for interactive
statistical programming and data analysis.  Languages supported
include: S dialects (S 3/4, S-PLUS 3.x, and R), LispStat dialects
(XLispStat, ViSta), and SAS.  Stata and SPSS dialect (SPSS, Fiasco)
support is being examined for possible future implementation (a
preliminary Stata mode is distributed).

ESS grew out of the desire for bug fixes and extensions to S-mode-4.8.
In particular, XEmacs support as well as extensions to incorporate R
were desired.  In addition, with new modes being developed for R,
Stata, and SAS, it was felt that providing for a unifying framework
would eliminate differences in the user interface, as well as to
provide for faster development of production tools and statistical
analysis.  5.0 has, for its guts, the basic framework from S-mode.
However, it has been cleaned, streamlined, brought closer to
conformance as a standard GNU Emacs package, and redesigned for
modularity and reuse.

The current development team is led by A.J. (Tony) Rossini
(rossini@biostat.washington.edu), who did the initial port to XEmacs
and has been the primary coder.  Martin Maechler
(maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch) and Kurt Hornik (hornik@ci.tuwien.ac.at)
have assisted with S-PLUS, S4, R, and XLispStat sub-modes, and Richard
M. Heiberger (rmh@fisher.stat.temple.edu) has done much of the work
for implementing the SAS sub-mode, as well as assisted with S-PLUS
(under MS Windows and remote access) and S4 development.  Douglas
Bates (bates@stat.wisc.edu) contributed the initial S4 mode, as well
as provided disk space, ftp and http access to the source for
development purposes.

We are grateful to David M. Smith , the previous developer (for S-mode
3.x and 4.x), as well as to the initial developers of S-mode, Doug
Bates, Ed Kademan and Frank Ritter.

In addition, some of the code has been and will be borrowed from Tom
Cook (from his excellent SAS mode) and Thomas Lumley (preliminary
Stata mode), gratefully (from us) and with permission (from them).

The name is ESS.  Not ESS-mode.

2. STABILITY
------------

Versions 5.1.x are meant as a beta-level releases.  While some bugs
are fixed from 5.0, others have been introduced, especially with
regards to new features.  See the file Doc/TODO for details.  Bug
reports are solicited; see the BUGS section below.  Patches or
suggested coding fixes with bug reports are much appreciated!

3. REQUIREMENTS
---------------

ESS version 5.2 requires Emacs version 19.29 or later, or version
XEmacs 19.14 or later.  ESS is supposed to work with any version of S,
S-PLUS, R, SAS, or XLispStat.

It has been most thoroughly tested with:

	S-PLUS 3.3 and 3.4, R 0.49 and 0.50, XLispStat 3.50, S4, and
	SAS on (when available) SunOS, Solaris, SGI, and Linux (Unix)
	systems;

	Emacs 19.29, 19.34, XEmacs 19.16, XEmacs 20.4.

	Emacs 19.28 with SAS (with additional modifications)

	NTEmacs 20.2.1 with S-PLUS 4.5.

It may need some work with other configurations.  We include
configuration suggestions for emacs 19.28 in Doc/README-19.28.
These are the changes we made in order to use ESS with SAS on a Digital
Alpha running Emacs 19.28.

Preliminary work for porting to Microsoft-developed operating systems
is on going, especially with Splus 4.x and NT Emacs.  Other possibly
connections include XLispStat (under the Splus DDE interface), R, SAS,
SPSS, and Stata.  In addition, XEmacs support (for native NT and
Cygwin versions) needs to be evaluated.


4. GETTING THE LATEST VERSION
-----------------------------

The latest versions of ESS are always available by WWW from:

	http://franz.stat.wisc.edu/pub/ESS/
	ftp://franz.stat.wisc.edu/pub/ESS/

The HTML version of the documentation can be found at:

	http://stat.ethz.ch/ESS/   (BROKEN!)

The latest (no more than 24 hours behind the developers) version of
ESS can also be retrieved using anonymous CVS.  Details on this are
forthcoming.

5. INSTALLATION  (from tar file)
---------------------------

* cd to a directory where you keep emacs lisp files, or create a new
  directory to hold the distribution.  This directory will be referred
  to below as "the ESS-5.0 distribution directory".  It will contain,
  at the end, the tar file ESS-5.0.tar.gz, and a directory for
  the ESS source, which will be termed "the ESS-5.0 directory".  Note
  that the .elc files may be installed elsewhere (as specified in the
  Makefile) if desired.

* Retrieve the compressed tar file from one of the FTP or WWW archive
  sites via FTP (or HTTP).

* Copy ESS-5.0.tar.gz to the location where you want the ESS-5.0
  directory, and cd there.  Extract the files from the distribution,
  which will unpack into a subdirectory, ESS-5.0.

	gunzip ESS-5.0.tar.gz
	tar vxf ESS-5.0.tar

	(or: gunzip < ESS-5.0.tar.gz | tar vxf - ).
	(or using GNU tar:  tar zvxf ESS-5.0.tar.gz).

  The tar command will extract files into the current directory.

  Do not create ESS-5.0 yourself, or you will get an extra level of
  depth to your directory structure.

* Edit the file ess-site.el as explained in the comments section of
  that file.  Installations that are using ESS only for S-plus 3.x
  will probably not need to make any changes.  Installations that also
  have one or more of (S4 R SAS XLispStat Stata) will need to uncomment
  corresponding lines in ess-site.el.

* READ THIS ITEM THOROUGHLY BEFORE STARTING:

  In the ESS-5.0 directory, edit the file Makefile (only if you want
  to place the executables in other locations; see LISPDIR and
  INFODIR) and then type:

	make
	make install

  This will install the info files (and the lisp files, if they
  are to go in another directory).  Don't forget to edit the file
  `dir' in the info directory specified by INFODIR in the Makefile.
  See the sample `dir' file for an example of the line to add.

  If you are using XEmacs, you might do:

	make EMACS=xemacs
	make EMACS=xemacs install

  instead of editing the Makefile.

  An alternative, if you are running XEmacs and have access to the
  XEmacs system directories, would be to place the directory in the
  site-lisp directory, and simply type "make"  (and copy the
  documentation as appropriate).

  For Emacs, you would still have to move the files into the top level
  site-lisp directory.

* Add the line

	(load "/PATH/ess-site")

  to your .emacs file (or default.el or site-init.el, for a site-wide
  installation).  Replace `/PATH' above with the value of
  ess-lisp-directory as defined in ess-site.el.

  Alternatively, if ess-site.el is in your current Lisp path, you can
  do:

	(require 'ess-site)

  to configure Emacs for ESS.

* (OPTIONAL) If you are running S-PLUS or R, you might consider
  installing the database files.  From within (X)Emacs, "C-x d" to the
  directory containing ESS.  Now:

       M-x S+3
  (get running.  once you have reached the SPLUS 3.x prompt, do:)
       M-x ess-create-object-name-db
  (this will create the file: ess-s+3-namedb.el; if it isn't in the
   ESS directory, move it there).

  Then, completions will be autoloaded and will not be regenerated for
  every session.

  For R:
      M-x R
  (get running.  once you have reached the R prompt, do:)
      M-x ess-create-object-name-db
  (this will create the file: ess-r-namedb.el; if it isn't in the
   ESS directory, move it there).


* For more information on using ESS in your daily work, see the files
  README.S, README.SAS, and README.XLispStat.


  For the impatient, the quick version of usage follows:

* To edit statistical programs, load the files with the requiste
  extensions  (".sas" for SAS, ".S" for S-PLUS, ".R" for R, and ".lsp"
  for XLispStat).

* To run statistical processes under (X)Emacs:

  Run S-PLUS 3.x with:

	M-x S+3

  (or M-x S  using backwards compatibility).  You will then be asked
  for a pathname ("S starting data directory?"), from which to start
  the process.

  If you wish to run R, you can start it with:

	M-x R

  XLispStat can be run with

	M-x XLS

  SAS can be run with:

	M-x SAS

* That's it!

5.1 Installation (using anonymous-CVS)

To be added.



6. BUGS
-------

Please send bug reports, suggestions etc. to

	ess-bugs@stat.math.ethz.ch

The easiest way to do this is within Emacs by typing

	M-x ess-submit-bug-report

This also gives the maintainers valuable information about your
installation which may help us to identify or even fix the bug.

7. THE ESS MAILING LIST
--------------------------

There is a mailing list for discussions and announcements relating to
ESS.  Join the list by sending an e-mail with "subscribe ess-help"
