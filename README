General Information: README
***************************

   ($Revision: 5.26 $, for ESS 5.1.x)

   This is the README file for the distribution of ESS version 5.1.18,
the alpha/beta series we are using on the way to producing 5.2 (the next
stable distribution).  ESS is an Emacs-Lisp interface for interactive
statistical programming and data analysis.  Languages supported include:
S dialects (S 3/4, S-PLUS 3.x, and R), LispStat dialects (XLispStat,
ViSta), and SAS.  Stata and SPSS dialect (SPSS, PSPP) support is being
examined for possible future implementation (a preliminary Stata mode is
distributed).

   Installation help can be found in sections for Unix Installation or
Windows Installion

For INSTALLATION, see way below.

   ESS grew out of the desire for bug fixes and extensions to
S-mode-4.8.  In particular, XEmacs support as well as extensions to
incorporate R were desired.  In addition, with new modes being
developed for R, Stata, and SAS, it was felt that providing for a
unifying framework would eliminate differences in the user interface,
as well as to provide for faster development of production tools and
statistical analysis.  5.1.y has, for its guts, the basic framework
from S-mode.  However, it has been cleaned, streamlined, brought closer
to conformance as a standard GNU Emacs package, and redesigned for
modularity and reuse.

   The current development team is led by A.J. (Tony) Rossini
(<rossini@biostat.washington.edu>), who did the initial port to XEmacs
and has been the primary coder.  Martin Maechler
(<maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>) and Kurt Hornik
(<hornik@ci.tuwien.ac.at>) have assisted with S-PLUS, S4, R, and
XLispStat sub-modes, and Richard M. Heiberger
(<rmh@fisher.stat.temple.edu>) has done much of the work for
implementing the SAS sub-mode, as well as assisted with S-PLUS (under MS
Windows and remote access) and S4 development.  Douglas Bates
(<bates@stat.wisc.edu>) contributed the initial S4 mode, as well as
provided disk space, ftp and http access to the source for development
purposes.

   We are grateful to David M. Smith, the previous developer (for S-mode
3.x and 4.x), as well as to the initial developers of S-mode, Doug
Bates, Ed Kademan and Frank Ritter.

   In addition, some of the code has been and will be borrowed from Tom
Cook (from his excellent SAS mode) and Thomas Lumley (preliminary Stata
mode), gratefully (from us) and with permission (from them).

   The name is ESS.  Not ESS-mode.

New Features
============

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.18:
   * New `ess-smart-underscore' function, now assigned to "_" by
     default.        Inserts `ess-S-assign' (customizable " <- "),
     unless inside string       and comments where plain "_" is used
     instead. (MM)

   * Fixes for longstanding interactive SAS breakage (RMH)

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.17:
   * Documentation for Windows Installation (Rich Heiberger
     (<rmh@surfer.stat.temple.edu>))

   * removal of ess-vars, finalization of customize support (in the
      sense that there is no more use of ess-vars, but that we need to
          fix ess-cust) (AJ Rossini (<rossini@u.washington.edu>))

   * Many small (and large) fixes/contributions (MMaechler,
     (<maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>)).

   * addition of the "S-equal" variable and provide M-x ess-add-MM-keys
          a way to remap "_" to `ess-S-assign', typically " <- ", but
         customizable. (MMaechler, (<maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>)).

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.16:
   * BUG FIXES

   * Better SAS support

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.15:
   * BUG FIXES

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.14:
   * Yet more fixes to SAS mode, (Rich Heiberger
     (<rmh@surfer.stat.temple.edu>) and Rodney Sparapani
     <rsparapa@mcw.edu>)).

   * Customize support (for most Emacsen which support it) (AJRossini,
         (<rossini@biostat.washington.edu>)

   * ARC and ViSta support out of the box, and fixes for XLispStat
     (AJRossini,       <rossini@biostat.washington.edu>)

   * Splus 5.1 stabilized, thanks to Martin Maechler, Bill Venables,
       Chuck Taylor, and others.

   * More fixes to SAS mode, thanks to Rodney Sparapani
     (<rsparapa@mcw.edu>) and Rich Heiberger
     (<rmh@surfer.stat.temple.edu>).

   * R documentation mode defaults changed

   Changes/New Features in 5.1.2:
   * able to use inferior iESS mode to communicate directly with a
     running S-Plus 4.x process using the Microsoft DDE protocol.  We
     use the familiar (from Unix ESS) C-c C-n and related key sequences
     to send lines from the S-mode file to the inferior S process.  We
     continue to edit S input files in ESS[S] mode and transcripts of
     previous S sessions in ESS Transcript mode.  All three modes know
     the S language, syntax, and indentation patterns and provide the
     syntactic highlighting that eases the programming tasks.

Stability
=========

   Versions 5.1.x are meant as a beta-level releases.  While some bugs
are fixed from 5.0, others have been introduced, especially with
regards to new features.  See the file Doc/TODO for details.  Bug
reports are solicited; see the BUGS section below.  Patches or
suggested coding fixes with bug reports are much appreciated!

   Some versions tend to be more stable than others, and for new support
(Microsoft support), 5.1.16 is the current favorite.

Requirements
============

   ESS version 5.1.n (n >= 2) requires Emacs version 19.29 or later, or
version XEmacs 19.14 or later.  It has been most thoroughly tested with:

   * S-PLUS versions 3.3, 3.4, 4.5, 5.0

   * R versions >=0.49

   * XLispStat versions >=3.50

   * S4

   * SAS

   * Stata >=6.0

   on the following platforms

   * SunOS (all)

   * Solaris (all)

   * SGI (all)

   * Linux (S-PLUS 5.0, R, XLispStat, S4, Stata 6.0)

   * Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT (SPLUS 4.5)

   with the following Emacsen:

   * Emacs 19.29, 19.34, 20.3, 20.4, XEmacs 19.16, XEmacs 20.4, XEmacs
     21.0

   * Emacs 19.28 with SAS (with additional modifications)

   * NTEmacs 20.3.1 with S-PLUS 4.5.

   It may need some work with other configurations.  We include
configuration suggestions for emacs 19.28 in Doc/README-19.28.  These
are the changes we made in order to use ESS with SAS on a Digital Alpha
running Emacs 19.28.

Getting the Latest Version
==========================

   The latest versions of ESS are always available by WWW from:

   	`http://ess.stat.wisc.edu/'
`ftp://ess.stat.wisc.edu/pub/ESS/'

   The HTML version of the documentation can be found at:

   `http://stat.ethz.ch/ESS/'

   The latest (no more than 24 hours behind the developers) version of
ESS can also be retrieved using anonymous CVS.  Details on this are
forthcoming.

Installation (from tar file)
============================

   We now discuss installation, which might happen under Unix or
Microsoft Windows.  First, we discuss Unix installation.

   Please skip to the next

  1.   cd to a directory where you keep emacs lisp files, or create a
     new   directory to hold the distribution.  This directory will be
     referred   to below as "the ESS distribution directory".  It will
     contain,   at the end, the tar file `ESS-5.1.18.tar.gz', and a
     directory for   the ESS source, which will be termed "the
     ESS-5.1.18 source directory".    Note that the .elc files may be
     installed elsewhere (as specified in the   Makefile) if desired.

  2.   Retrieve the compressed tar file from one of the FTP or WWW
     archive   sites via FTP (or HTTP).

  3.   Copy `ESS-5.1.18.tar.gz' to the location where you want the
     ESS-5.1.18 directory, and cd there.  Extract the files from the
     distribution, which will unpack into a subdirectory, ESS-5.1.18.
          	gunzip ESS-5.1.18.tar.gz
          	tar vxf ESS-5.1.18.tar
     	(or: `gunzip < ESS-5.1.18.tar.gz | tar vxf -' ).  	(or using GNU
     tar:  `tar zvxf ESS-5.1.18.tar.gz').

     The `tar' command will extract files into the current directory.

     Do not create ESS-5.1.18 yourself, or you will get an extra level
     of   depth to your directory structure.

  4.   Edit the file `lisp/ess-site.el' as explained in the comments
     section of that file.  Installations that are using ESS only for
     S-plus   3.x will probably not need to make any changes.
     Installations that also   have one or more of (S+5 S4 R SAS
     XLispStat Stata) may need to uncomment   corresponding lines in
     `ess-site.el'.

  5.   READ THIS ITEM THOROUGHLY BEFORE STARTING:

     YOU DO NOT NEED TO RUN THROUGH THESE STEPS IN ORDER TO USE ESS.
     YOU   ONLY NEED TO EDIT AND LOAD (into Emacs) `lisp/ess-site' TO
     START USING ESS.  THESE STEPS COMPILE (for a small gain in speed)
     AND CREATE THE DOCUMENTATION.

     In the ESS-5.1.18 directory, edit the file `Makeconf' (only if you
      want to place the executables in other locations; see LISPDIR and
      INFODIR) and then type:
          	make

     If this works, then you might try:
          	make install
       Note that the latter does the former as well, so if you are
     feeling   lucky, you might want to skip it.

     This will install the info files (and the lisp files, if they are
     to go   in another directory).  Don't forget to edit the file
     `dir' in the   info directory specified by `INFODIR' in
     `doc/Makefile'.  See   the sample `dir' file for an example of the
     line to add.

     If you are using XEmacs, you might do:
          	make EMACS=xemacs

     and then
          	make EMACS=xemacs install
       instead of editing the Makefile.

     _Note_ that you might need to use GNU make for everything to
     work properly

     An alternative, if you are running XEmacs and have access to the
     XEmacs system directories, would be to place the directory in the
     site-lisp directory, and simply type `make' (and copy the
     documentation as appropriate).

     For Emacs, you would still have to move the files into the top
     level   site-lisp directory.

  6.   Add the line
            (load "/PATH/ess-site")
       to your .emacs file (or default.el or site-init.el, for a
     site-wide   installation).  Replace `/PATH' above with the value of
      ess-lisp-directory as defined in ess-site.el.

     Alternatively, if ess-site.el is in your current Lisp path, you can
      do:
          	(require 'ess-site)
       to configure Emacs for ESS.

  7.   (OPTIONAL) If you are running S-PLUS or R, you might consider
     installing the database files.  From within (X)Emacs, `C-x d' to
     the   directory containing ESS.  Now:
                 M-x S+3
       (or `M-x S+5': get running.  once you have reached the SPLUS
     prompt, do:)
                 M-x ess-create-object-name-db
       (this will create the file `ess-s+3-namedb.el'; if it isn't in
     the    ESS directory, move it there).

     Then, completions will be autoloaded and will not be regenerated
     for   every session.

     For R, do the same, using
                M-x R
       and then `M-x ess-create-object-name-db' creating
     `ess-r-namedb.el'; if it isn't in the ESS directory, move it
     there).

  8.   For more information on using ESS in your daily work, see the
     files   README.S, README.SAS, and README.XLispStat.

     For the impatient, the quick version of usage follows:

  9.   To edit statistical programs, load the files with the requiste
     extensions  (".sas" for SAS, ".S" for S-PLUS, ".R" for R, and
     ".lsp"   for XLispStat).

 10.   To run statistical processes under (X)Emacs:

     Run S-PLUS 3.x with:
          	M-x S+3
       (or M-x S  using backwards compatibility).  You will then be
     asked   for a pathname ("S starting data directory?"), from which
     to start   the process.  Similarly for S-PLUS 5.x.

     If you wish to run R, you can start it with:
          	M-x R

     XLispStat can be run with
          	M-x XLS

     SAS can be run with:
          	M-x SAS

 11.   That's it!

   For Microsoft Windows installation, please follow the next steps:
(see separate instructions above for UNIX)

  1.     cd to a directory where you keep emacs lisp files, or create a
     new    directory (for example, `c:\emacs\') to hold the
     distribution.  This    directory will be referred to below as "the
     ESS distribution    directory".  It will contain, at the end,
     either the tar file    `ESS-5.1.18.tar.gz' or the zip file
     `ESS-5.1.18.zip', and a    directory    for the ESS source, which
     will be termed "the ESS-5.1.18 source    directory".

  2.       Retrieve the compressed tar file `ESS-5.1.18.tar.gz' or the
        zipped file `ESS-5.1.18.zip' from one of the FTP or WWW
     archive sites      via FTP (or HTTP).  Be aware that http browsers
     on Windows      frequently change the "." and "-" characters in
     filenames to other      punctuation.  Please change the names back
     to their original form.

  3.       Copy `ESS-5.1.18.tar.gz' to the location where you want the
        ESS-5.1.18 directory, for example to
     `c:\emacs\ESS-5.1.18.tar.gz', and cd there.  For example,

                       cd c:\emacs

     Extract the files from the distribution, which will unpack
     into a subdirectory, `ess-5.1.18'.
                    	gunzip ESS-5.1.18.tar.gz
                    	tar vxf ESS-5.1.18.tar
          	(or: `gunzip < ESS-5.1.18.tar.gz | tar vxf -' ).
        (or: from the zip file: `unzip ESS-5.1.18.zip')

     The `tar' command will extract files into the current directory.

     Do not create `ess-5.1.18' yourself, or you will get an extra level
         of   depth to your directory structure.

  4.      Windows users will usually be able to use the
     `lisp/ess-site.el'      as distributed.  Only rarely will changes
     be needed.

  5.       Windows users will need to make sure that the directories
     for the      software they will be using is in the PATH
     environment variable.  On      Windows 9x, add lines similar to
     the following to your      `c:\autoexec.bat'      file:
                   path=%PATH%;c:\progra~1\spls2000\cmd
          On Windows NT/2000, add the directories to the PATH using the
         MyComputer menu.  Note that the directory containing the
     program is      added to the PATH, not the program itself.  One
     such line is needed      for each software program.  Be sure to
     use the abbreviation      `progra~1' and not the long version with
     embedded blanks.  Use      backslashes "\".

  6.       Add the line
                      (load "/PATH/ess-site")
          to your .emacs (or _emacs) file (or default.el or
     site-init.el, for      a site-wide installation).  Replace `/PATH'
     above with the      value of ess-lisp-directory as defined in
     `ess-site.el'.  Use      forwardslashes `/'.

  7.       (OPTIONAL) If you are running Sqpe or R, you might consider
        installing the database files.  From within (X)Emacs, `C-x d'
     to      the   directory containing ESS.  Now:
                           M-x Sqpe+4
            (get running.  once you have reached the SPLUS prompt, do:)
                           M-x ess-create-object-name-db
            (this will create the file `ess-s+4-namedb.el'; if it isn't
     in the        ESS directory, move it there).

     Then, completions will be autoloaded and will not be regenerated
       for every session.

     For R, do the same, using
                          M-x R
          and then `M-x ess-create-object-name-db' creating
     `ess-r-namedb.el'; if it isn't in the ESS directory, move it
     there).

  8.       For more information on using ESS in your daily work, see the
         files doc/README.SPLUS4WIN, doc/README.S, doc/README.SAS, and
         doc/README.XLispStat.

     For the impatient, the quick version of usage follows:

  9.       To edit statistical programs, load the files with the
     requisite      extensions  (".sas" for SAS, ".S" or "s" or "q" or
     "Q" for S-PLUS,      ".r" or ".R" for R, and ".lsp"   for
     XLispStat).

 10.       To run statistical processes under (X)Emacs:

     Run S-PLUS 4.x or 2000 with:
                    	M-x S+4
            (or `M-x S').  You will then be      asked for a pathname
     ("S starting data directory?"), from which to      start the
     process.  The prompt will propose your current directory      as
     the default.  Similarly for S-PLUS 6.x.  Send lines or regions
     from the emacs buffer containing your S program (for example,
     `myfile.s') to the S-Plus Commands Window with the      `C-c C-n'
     or `C-c C-r' keys.

     Run S-PLUS 4.x or 2000 inside an emacs buffer
                    	M-x Sqpe+4
          You will then be asked for a pathname ("S starting data
     directory?"), from which to start the process.  The prompt will
      propose your current directory as the default.  Similarly for
     S-PLUS      6.x.  Send lines or regions from the emacs buffer
     containing your S      program (for example, `myfile.s') to the
     *S+4* buffer with the      `C-c C-n' or `C-c C-r' keys.  You do
     not have access to      interactive graphics in      this mode.
     You get Unix-like behavior, in particular the entire
     transcript is available for emacs-style search commands.

     If you wish to run R, you can start it with:
                    	M-x R

     XLispStat can not currently be run with
                    	M-x XLS
          Hopefully, this will change.  However, you can still edit with
         Emacs, and cut and paste the results into the XLispStat
     *Listener* Window under Microsoft Windows.

     SAS for Windows uses the batch access with function keys that is
       described in `doc/README.SAS'.

     SAS for Windows cannot be run with:
                    	M-x SAS
          Reason:  we use ddeclient to interface with programs and SAS
     doesn't      provide the corresponding ddeserver capability.

 11. That's it!
