(defun ess-add-path (path &rest options)
  "Add PATH to `load-path' if it exists under `default-load-path'
directories and it does not exist in `load-path'.

You can use following PATH styles:
	load-path relative: \"PATH/\"
			(it is searched from `defaul-load-path')
	home directory relative: \"~/PATH/\" \"~USER/PATH/\"
	absolute path: \"/HOO/BAR/BAZ/\"

You can specify following OPTIONS:
	'all-paths	search from `load-path'
			instead of `default-load-path'
	'append		add PATH to the last of `load-path'.

For ESS, ONLY use load-path, since Emacs doesn't have
default-load-path."
