	* S-trans.el: Defined S-transcript-send-command-and-move

	* S-menu.el: Dunno.

Fri Apr 29 14:30:55 1994  David M. Smith  (maa036@mathssun5)

	* S-mode.el:
	S-continued-statement-p: minor bugfix. Removed the (bolp) test; I
	don't know why it was there but it caused top-level statements to be
	indented.

	S-insert-local-variables: removed (obsolete)

	* S-mode.el: S-dump-object-into-edit-buffer: rewrite.  Implemented
	S-delete-dump-files.

	* S.el: New option S-delete-dump-files

	* S.el: Version number change (4.3)

Thu Apr 28 12:58:41 1994  David M. Smith  (maa036@mathssun5)

	* S-mode.el: Definition and implementation of S-mode-silently-save.

Fri Apr 22 14:40:56 1994  David M. Smith  (maa036@mathssun5)

	* splitup2/S-inf.el (S-get-directory): Cause an error if an
	  invalid directory is specified.

Wed Mar 16 14:19:31 1994  David M. Smith  (maa036@mathssun5.lancs.ac.uk)

	* splitup2/S-inf.el (inferior-S-primary-prompt): prompts are
	  optionally followed by one space.
	  (S-complete-object-name): No longer runs indent-for-tab-command
	  (S-after-pathname-p): deleted
	  (S-complete-filename): New function
	  (inferior-S-mode): Better completion support, thanks to the new
	  comint.

Wed Feb 23 15:50:28 1994  David M. Smith  (maa036@mathssun5.lancs.ac.uk)

	* splitup2/S-inf.el (S-search-list): Bugfix where relative
	  pathnames in search list were expanded in wrong directory

Fri Feb 18 19:27:10 1994  David M. Smith  (maa036@mathssun5.lancs.ac.uk)

	* splitup2/S-mode.el (S-check-modifications): Don't cause an error
	  if the source file has been deleted.

Tue Feb 15 12:11:42 1994  David M. Smith  (maa036@mathssun5.lancs.ac.uk)

	* splitup2/S-inf.el (S-temp-buffer-p): Deleted. There is no longer
	  any dependence on this variable: S-local-process-name suffices.
	(S-local-variables-string): Deleted. File extensions should be
	good enough for setting the mode.
	(S-cleanup): Simplified. Doesn't delete files.

	* splitup2/S-help.el (S-help-mode): Make S-local-process-name
	  local.

	* splitup2/S-mode.el (S-mode): make S-local-process-name
	  permanent-local.
	  (S-insert-function-templates): deleted, S-function-template has
	  this functionality now.
	  (S-function-template): May be nil or a string. Point is placed
	  after first open.

	  (S-dump-object-into-edit-buffer): If S-keep-dump-files is nil,
	  don't delete files, but don't make backups either.

Mon Feb 14 14:53:17 1994  David M. Smith  (maa036@mathssun5.lancs.ac.uk)

	* splitup2/S-mode.el (S-check-modifications): New function
	(S-load-file): Rewrite. Only ask for a filename if the current
	buffer is not in S-mode. Always offer to save.

	* splitup2/S-inf.el (S-inf-filenames-map): New variable
	(S-object-names): Use it
	(S-extract-onames-from-alist): Supply directory name
	(S-get-modtime-list): Supply directory name for quicker completions

	(S-object-modtime): New function

	* splitup2/S-mode.el (S-mode): Set parse-sexp-ignore-comments to
	  t; there are no longer any limitations with this in elisp.

Wed Feb  9 13:25:12 1994  David M. Smith  (maa036@mathssun5.lancs.ac.uk)

	* splitup2/S-trans.el (S-transcript-send-command-and-move): New
	  function

	  (S-transcript-send-command): Doesn't move any more.

	* splitup2/S-inf.el (S-eval-visibly): Call
	  comint-output-filter-functions

Wed Jan 26 11:15:46 1994  David Smith  (maa507@mathssun5.lancs.ac.uk)

	* S.el 	(S-search-list): Caches result in S-search-list <v>
	(S-execute-objects): Use it
	(S-search-list <v>): Now just a cache. Don't access directly
	Completions are now calculated on demand; as a result the first
	completion in a session will take a long time. The results are
	cached, however, so remaining completions should be fast.

Sun Jan 23 17:56:46 1994  David Smith  (maa507@mathssun5.lancs.ac.uk)

	* S.el (S): If S-ask-for-S-directory is unset, set
	  default-directory to S-directory.

Wed Jan 19 16:16:10 1994  David Smith  (maa507@mathssun5.lancs.ac.uk)

	* S-site.el: Added (cond (window-system ...)) calls so that all
	  users (even those without window systems) can safely require
	  this file.

Thu Jan  6 15:15:53 1994  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

        Version 4.1alpha released to wingra
	* S.el: deleted S-set-display and associated variables.

Fri Dec 24 11:56:00 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (S-command): Rewrite. Now uses a new filter to redirect
	  output to the buffer; comint never sees the output. This filter
	  could feasibly be accomodated to detect the prompt itself;
	  allowing for an "in the background" implementation of S-command.

	  (S-process-sentinel): Reports date; useful if you have run many
	  S sessions in one transcript file.

Thu Dec 16 12:47:38 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (S-multi): Ask for transcript file, maybe
	(S-ask-about-transfile): new variable
	(S-get-directory): replaces S-set-directory

Wed Dec 15 12:10:11 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (S-loop-timeout): Increased

Mon Dec 13 10:11:25 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (S-command): Avoids calling comint-output-filter-functions
	  until the last minute.
	  (S-complete-object-name): Complete rewrite of completion
	  routines. Completion should now be accurate in every situation:
	  the only way to make it wrong is to use assign() to assign into
	  a dataframe not at position 1. Uses objects() to make listings,
	  so you don't get .Data, .Help etc. Should now be able to make
	  this work for DOS users.
	(S-object-list): New buffer-local vbl; cache of completions

Thu Dec  9 12:08:09 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (S-process-sentinel): Can now see message after q()

Tue Nov 16 09:25:41 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (S-mode): kill-all-local-variables
	(S-insert-local-variables): Use ### instead of # in local
	variables section.

Mon Nov 15 10:31:02 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (inferior-S-mode): Changed
	  comint-after-partial-pathname-command to
	  comint-after-partial-filename-command (new comint)

Sun Nov 14 17:18:55 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el: Version 4.00alpha. Made available for FTP, and
	  announced on the S-mode mailing list

Fri Nov 12 12:36:06 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (S-transcript-mode): Created.
	(S-execute-screen-options): Added.

Thu Nov 11 12:30:06 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (S-find-help-file): More intuitive defaults when requesting
	  help generated by S-read-helpobj-name-default.

	  (S-eval-visibly): Doesn't wait for prompt after the last line of
	  text has been sent.

	  (inferior-S-send-input): Big improvement in the handling of
	  multi-line inputs. Users should use LFD (not RET) to continue
	  incomplete commands. Should automate this.

Thu Oct  7 14:45:00 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (inferior-S-mode): Few mods to make it work with the new
	  comint.

Mon Sep 27 11:21:56 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (inferior-S-get-old-input): Now separates multi-line
	  commands by newlines instead of spaces. This produces messier
	  output, but avoids S's 255 char line limit for commands.

Sun Sep 26 17:38:59 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (S-kill-buffer-function): Added to kill-buffer-hook in the
	  process buffer.

Fri Sep 17 11:23:36 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (S-display-temp-buffer): Uses temp-buffer-show-function
	  instead of popper.

	  (inferior-S-mode): Fixed a typo of paragraph-separate appearing
	  as paragraph-start.

Wed Sep 15 11:47:51 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el: Converted old E18 variables (buffer-flush-undo,
	  comment-indent-hook) to E19 versions. Removed the require for
	  comint-extra -- now contained in the new comint.el. Removed
	  autoload for comint-isearch -- that's the user's decision.
	(inferior-S-prompt): Now generated from inferior-S-primary-prompt
	  and (new variable) inferior-S-secondary-prompt

Tue Sep 14 09:33:03 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (S-multi): Makes use of Simon Marshall's new comint.el. New
  	  variable S-history-file for saving histories. Calls
  	  comint-read-input-ring. Sets the sentinel.
	(S-process-sentinel): Created. Automatically saves the history
	  ring if the S process dies.

Sun Sep 12 18:53:40 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el: (S-multi). Now always switches to the buffer associated
	  with process N, if available.

	(inferior-S-make-comint): New calling procedure; bufname is the
	  literal buffer name (no *'s are added); procname is the process
	  name to use.

Tue Sep  7 16:20:11 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (inferior-S-mode-map): Unbound comint-[mp]search input, and
	comint-isearch, as I haven't tested them yet.
	(inferior-S-mode): replaced input-ring-size with
	comint-input-ring-size (Vivek Khera <khera@cs.duke.edu>).

	* comint-extra.el: Added comint-msearch* and comint-psearch*,
	commented out in the E19 distribution of comint.el

	* comint-isearch.el: Back in the distribution

Fri Sep  3 16:20:28 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (S-mode): Replaced the documentation string, and removed
	the code which set it explicitly. Doing this was breaking the byte
	compiler. Version 3.63

Wed Aug 25 17:36:57 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (inferior-S-send-input): Added a hook: S-send-input-hook,
	so that I could do nice things with highlighting. This will
	probably disappear or change.

Sat Aug 14 14:48:11 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam)

	* S.el (S-extract-onames-from-alist): Modified so that
  	S-complete-object-name will work in the minibuffer (e.g. through
	command S-execute.)

	* S.el: Restructured the entire S.el file into meaningful
	sections. The file now uses Outline mode.

	* S.el: Tek mode is no longer supported. Moved all Tek-related
	variables and functions to S-tek.el, and commented out any code
	references to them.

	* S-tek.el: This file is no longer supported. Moved all
	Tek-related functions and variables in S.el to the end of this
	file.

Wed Aug  4 16:35:24 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam)

	* S.el (S-complete-object-name): Fixed regexp so that completion
	over lists works properly.

Thu Jul 22 12:25:46 1993  David Smith  (maa507@mathssun4)

	* S.el: Uses s-menu instead of s-simple-menus.

	* s-menu.el: Totally rehacked from s-simple-menus.el to use
	easymenu.el, to take advantage of Emacs 19 menus.

	* S.el: Rehacked the multiple process code so that local variables
	are used to store process-specific variables. I really don't know
	why I didn't do this in the first place. As a result multiple
	processes actually seem to work, now.
	(S-request-a-process): Now enters initial input

Sun Jul 18 12:15:27 1993  David Smith  (maa507@mathssun4)

	* S.el: Created this change log file, and moved the change log
	from S.el here.

The following is from the original Changelog section of S.el

  Release 2.1 on October 14, 1991 to statlib@stat.cmu.edu,
     and to the elisp archives at OSU (brennan@dg-rtp.dg.com (Dave Brennan))
  and announced on internet.s-news, netnews.gnu.emacs.sources, &
    andrew.programs.S
 -------------------------------------------------------
     Jul 26          1991  Frank Ritter
   * added S-mode-load-hook & S-pre-run-hook
     and testing by neilc@research.att.com
     Jul 9           1991  Frank Ritter
   * Changed S-command to use a register rather than
       the kill ring.
   * Better file header, comments now at 60 col so
       mailers wont' eat them.
   * Better S-extract-word-name.
   * Added S-mode-version variable
   * Changed syntax table to read |#; appropriately

 Wed Nov 28 11:03:50 1990  Ed Kademan  (kademan at hermes)
   * Make the S-mode-syntax-table a slightly modified
       version of the c-mode-syntax-table instead of a
       version of the one for lisp.

 Sat Nov 10 12:41:52 1990  Ed Kademan  (kademan at hermes)
   * Made run-S and run-s commands synonymous with the
       function S.

 Fri Oct 19 12:41:52 1990  Ed Kademan  (kademan at hermes)
   * Made S-directory a user modifiable variable.  S will
       run from that directory.

 Thu Oct 18 12:41:52 1990  Ed Kademan  (kademan at hermes)
   * Added function S-nuke-help-bs to clean up nroff
       style text in the S help buffer.  This function is
       a modification of nuke-nroff-bs from man.el.
 -------------------------------------------------------
 Unnumbered version released dated Thu Jun 14 09:56:56 CDT 1990

 Fri Jan 17 1992 Dave Smith (dsmith@stats.adelaide.edu.au)
   * Help mode for reading files. When asking for an object to
     run help on, completion is over those help files that exist.
   * Added object name completion, and made S-get-object-list
     efficient enough to make it worthwile.
   * Error parsing for loaded files
   * Better customization of file-names, with sensible defaults
   * Sensible buffer names for object buffers
   * Corrected definition for `.' in syntax table
   * Improved (and simplified) S-read-object-name-default
   * Included pager='cat' to default help-command specification
   * Added a call to run-hook for S-pre-run-hook
   * Changed keymaps to conform with GNU guidelines
     (i.e. no \C-letter bindings)
   * S-command has a new third argument, visible

 Tue May 27 1992 Dave Smith (dsmith@stats.adelaide.edu.au)
   * now copes with dynamically changing prompts (reported by Doug Bates)

 Thu May 29 1992 Dave Smith (dsmith@stats.adelaide.edu.au)
   * Added S-execute, modified S-execute-* to use it.

 Mon Jun 22 1992 dsmith
   * Added S-mode editing commands written by Ken'ichi Shibayama
     (shiba@isac.co.jp). A big win.
   * Removed the redundant argument to S-switch-to-end-of-S
   * S-function-pattern improved
   * added S-eval-visibly, S-eval-visibly-p and modified S-eval-*
     to use them
   * added S-eval-line-and-next-line
   * eval commands can now echo in the process buffer
   * added S-kill-output and S-view-at-bottom
   * added a binding for comint-isearch and autoloaded it
   * added S-execute-in-tb. S-parse-errors now takes prefix arg.

 Thu Jun 25 1992 dsmith
   * Moved some doctrings to comments (Frank Ritter)
   * The Tek stuff now lives in a separate file (Frank Ritter)
   * Fiddly C-c ESC M-. bindings in S mode and Help mode moved
       to C-c M-. bindings (Martin Maechler)
   * S-execute-objects now uses variable inferior-S-objects-command
       whose value depends on S version. (Ken'ichi Shibayama)
   * Symbols given uniform prefixes: S- or inferior-S- (Frank Ritter)

 -- Version 3.41 released to Statlib and Emacs Archive --

 Tue Jul  7 11:56:59 CST 1992 dsmith
   * S-execute-attach now updates the internal search list. This
     is a manifestation of a general bug: S-command doesn't call
     S-search-path-tracker

 Wed Jul 29 09:38:54 CST 1992 kenichi
   * Several fixes to indenting code. New variable S-else-offset.
     Indentation of code not within braces. expression() indentation.
     Correct handling of in-line comments.

 Fri Aug  7 10:52:06 CST 1992 dsmith
   * S-execute now uses S-mode-minibuffer-map.
   * Setting indentation variables in .emacs now has some effect.
   * Files retrieved by S-dump-object-into-scratch are now automatically
     placed in S-mode.

 Fri Jul 28 1992 R.D.Ball
   added multi-S to allow multiple S sessions
   run by ESC-x S or with numeric prefix arg e.g. ESC-2 ESC-x S
   The current S process is determined by S-process-name,
   this is modified by typing a return into a non-current S process
   buffer.
   Variables S-process-name-list, S-current-process-name
   and functions update-S-process-name-list, get-S-process to
   replace (get-process "*S*"), and checks for existence of process,
   buffer in inferior-S-mode

   made function S-eval-line-and-next-line keep to the bottom of
   the S process buffer so user can see results when working interactiveley
   To do this an optional arg eob was added to S-eval-visibly
   To go to bottom of window it was necessary to use
   switch-to-buffer-other-window, but this only when eob is t.
   Additionally, if S-eval-visibly-at-end is t the functions
   S-eval-region etc. also display results at the end of the
   current process buffer.

   Default directory for starting S is now the current directory
   for the current buffer. (Set S-use-current-directory to nil to
   avoid this).


 Sat Sep 19 18:35:10 CST 1992 dmsith

   * Modified Rod's multi-S code so that it works properly.
     S-process-name-list is now an alist whose CARs are the process
     names and whose CDRs is an alist of variable . value pairs
     specific to particular processes (so e.g. completion works
     properly for each buffer.) The function
     S-get-process-specific-vbls does the work, and any
     process-specific variables should be mentioned here.
     S-mode buffers know which process they should evaluate into.

   * New command S-request-a-process which should be bound to a key.

 Wed Nov  4 dsmith
   * S-load-file now informs you if S gave a warning during load.
     Also, the S-errors buffer is displayed using popper, if available
   * C-x ` is now also bound in S-mode.
   * Installed Frank's menus

 Wed Nov 18 dsmith
   * Bound M-TAB and M-? to comint completion functions in inf-S-mode
     and S-mode
   * In the process buffer, a paragraph is a promwpt, a command and its
     output, to make the paragraph functions useful
   * Multiple S sessions in a process buffer are delimited by ^L, to
     make the page functions useful
   * In process buffer mode line, name of process is shown in [..]
     (in case buffer name is changed.) In edit buffers, the name
     if the process the buffer belongs to is shown in []'s

 Wed Nov 21 dsmith
   * Nuked S-make-function, since it is now obsolete
   * Added S-clean-region
   * M-TAB in S-mode now completes *files*, not objects. Object
     completion has moved to C-c TAB.
   * Bound k in the help buffer to 'kill-buffer.
   * Local variables are added to files accessed with C-c C-d, if needed.
   * Fixed incorrect use of 'save-buffer in several places.
   * Bound C-c C-p to 'S-request-a-process
   * Replaced S-beginning-of-function and S-end-of-function to DMS's
     versions, since Frank's don't work with the new function regexp.
   * New variable S-synchronize-evals (Martin Maechler)
   * Changed default of S-eval-visibly-p to t.

 Wed May 12 dmith
   * Change definition of S-dumped-missing-re to cope with 3.1
